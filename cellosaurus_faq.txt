 Description: Cellosaurus: frequently asked questions
 Version: 20.0
 Last update: 01-December-2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I cite the Cellosaurus in a publication?

A: Currently there is no paper describing the Cellosaurus, so you can cite
it in the following manner:

Bairoch A.
The Cellosaurus: a cell line knowledge resource.
http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How can I contact the Cellosaurus so as to propose an update to an
existing entry or a new entry?

A: You can either click on the "contact" link on the top right of all
Cellosaurus web pages or send an email to "cellosaurus@sib.swiss"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How frequently is the Cellosaurus upated?

A: Currently there is no regular update schedule, but we try to release new
versions of the Cellosaurus at least 4 times per year.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Are plant cell lines going to be added to the Cellosaurus?

A: Currently there is no plan to increase the coverage of the Cellosaurus to
plant cell lines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Are patient-derived xenografts and other transplantable tumors going to be
added to the Cellosaurus?

A: This is something undergoing internal discussion and if you think that
it would be useful to add them, please let us know!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Is it possible to directly indicate search terms in a URL?

A: Yes, you can do so with the following syntax:

http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=your_query

Examples:

http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=CVCL_0030
http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=hela
http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=sus+scrofa
http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input="fish cell line"
http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=problematic+cell+line
http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input="PubMed=1000501"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Can I save the Cellosaurus records corresponding to the result of a search?

A: Not yet, but this is someting we would like to implement in a future version
of the web interface

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I would like to order cell XYZ from you?

A: We are not selling or distributing any cell lines. The Cellosaurus is a
knowledge resource on cell lines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Where can I buy cell line XYZ?

A: The Cellosaurus provides cross-references or web links to the main
organisations and companies selling or distributing cell lines. You will
find these links in the relevant cell line entries.

Important caveats:

We try to be as inclusive as possible but the lack of indication of the
availability of a cell line in a Cellosaurus entry can not be considered
as a proof that the cell line is not available somewhere.

The list of cell lines distributed by a given entity is very dynamic and
we can't insure to be in perfect synchronization with all the entities that
are involved in cell line distribution.

Hereunder we provide links to a number of companies and organisation that
provide cell lines. We encourage you to browse their online catalog.

Q: Why is supplier XYZ not listed above?
A: There are many cell line suppliers and while we strive to be comprehensive
we are probably missing a number of organizations/companies that distribute
cell lines. So let us know if you think a supplier should be added to the
list.

But you should also be aware that:

1) We may have been informed by members of the scientific community that a
supplier distributes cell lines that are not tested for authenticity or have
been obtained illegally. We will remove the supplier from our list if we are
requested to do so for those reasons.

2) We do not list suppliers that act solely as redistributors for another
organisation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Is there a difference in the content of the Cellosaurus in the ASCII (TXT),
OBO and XML formats?

Yes, you should be aware that:

The OBO format file (cellosaurus.obo) does not contain STR profile data.

And while the ASCII and XML versions of the Cellosaurus have the same
data content, there are some differences in terms of the organization of
the data. These differences are described below.

The ASCII version is split into two data files: cellosaurus.txt and
cellosaurus_refs.txt, the first file contains all the Cellosaurus
information except for the full reference records which are stored in the
second file. This is not the case for the XML version which consists of
a single data file, cellosaurus.xml and a XML schema definition file,
cellosaurus.xsd

In the ASCII file cross-references to external resources do not contain
the URLs of these cross-references, these can be instantiated using the
information stored in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why is cell line ABCD reported to originate from a male individual but its
authentication value for amelogenin is reported as "X" instead of "X,Y"?

A: Nearly half of male cancer cell lines are incorrectly identified as female.
Authentication testing kits usually include sex-specific markers such as
the amelogenin gene. Frequent loss or mutation of this gene has been observed
resulting in a false-negative call for presence of the Y chromosome and the
sample typing as female. Loss of an intact Y chromosome has also been
observed, sometimes with residual fragments found in other chromosomes
suggesting a catastrophic chromosomal event in these cancer cells. Loss of
the Y chromosome is also evident in normal physiology. In cases where the
autosomal STR results match the original sample, but the allosome results
are not what is expected, this indicates the cell line origin is correct but
further investigation is required to understand the sex of the sample.

PS: Thanks to Richard Neve and Amanda Capes-Davies for providing this very
informative answer.
