2) Changes in the CC "Sequence variation" lines

These lines have been completely structured, contains cross-references
to HGNC, MGI, RGD, UniProtKB and to VGNC to indicate the variation target
gene and to ClinVar or dbSNP when the variation is described in one of
these resources.

In addition the "Sequence variation" topic has 4 subtopics:

 [1] Gene amplification
 [2] Gene deletion
 [3] Gene fusion
 [4] Mutation

Note that in this release the XML format file has not yet been modified to
accomodate these changes and the sequence variation information is in the
structured string format described above. We will make the changes to the
XML format for the next release.

3) Changes in the DR lines

3a) Cross-references were added to the PerkinElmer cell line collection.
Up to now we provided web links to the product description pages but having
found a way to use the PerkinElmer catalog number we have converted these
links to cross-references.
