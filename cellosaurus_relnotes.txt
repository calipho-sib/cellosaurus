This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 45 of March 2023

1) Statistics

145368 cell lines (107864 human, 26311 mouse, 2734 rat)
   805 species represented
106123 synonyms
421462 cross-references to 103 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
152339 references to 26279 distinct publications (papers, patents, theses, etc.)
 14157 web links

  8520 human, mouse and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 796 distinct sources)

Since release 44 of December 2022:
  1071 entries were created
144567 entries were updated (note: all entries were updated due to the change
       in the OX line described below).

2) Changes concerning the OX (species of origin) line

We have added, in between parenthesis, the species common name after the
binomial nomenclature designation

For example:
OX   NCBI_TaxID=9606; ! Homo sapiens
is now:
OX   NCBI_TaxID=9606; ! Homo sapiens (Human)

3) Changes in CC lines

3a) Change in the referencing of Cellosaurus entries

In comments lines references to Cellosaurus entries used to be indicated
using the accession of the entry between brackets "(CVCL_XXXX)". Accessions
are now prefixed by 'Cellosaurus=' as in "(Cellosaurus=CVCL_XXXX)".

For example:
CC   Characteristics: Control cell line for 293 TRE/FLAG-POLK (CVCL_4W26).
is now:
CC   Characteristics: Control cell line for 293 TRE/FLAG-POLK (Cellosaurus=CVCL_4W26).

3b) Changes in the CC Misspelling

In the XML format information concerning the "Misspelling" comment is now
structured and represented in the "misspelling-list" element.

3c) Changes in the CC Omics

We have changed the label of 4 existing "Omics" tags relevant to transcriptome
studies to make them more homogenous.

CC   Omics: Deep RNAseq analysis.
is now:
CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis by RNAseq.

CC   Omics: ESTs sequenced.
is now:
CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis by ESTs sequencing.

CC   Omics: Single cell RNAseq analysis.
is now:
CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis by single cell RNAseq.

CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis.
is now:
CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis by microarray.

And we introduced two new transcriptome studies tags:

CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS).
CC   Omics: Transcriptome analysis by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE).

4) Changes concerning cross-references

Cross-references were added to the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry.
Prevously web links were provided to this resources, but we upgraded them to
cross-references.
