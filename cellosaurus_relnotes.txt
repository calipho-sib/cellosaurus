This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 18 of July 2016.

1) Statistics

 6xxxx cell lines (5xxxx human, 5xxx mouse, 1xxx rat)
   5xx species represented 
 3xxxx synonyms
1xxxxx cross-references to 52 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 4xxxx references to 1xxxx distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
  7xxx web links

2) Introduction of a new line type (AS) to store secondary accession number(s)

Occasionally Cellosaurus entries have to be merged because they are found to
describe identical cell lines. Until this release we would keep one of the two 
accession numbers and store the second one in the "cellosaurus_deleted_ACs.txt"
file where we would indicate to which entry the data concerning the obsoleted 
accession number was integrated. Example:

CVCL_0116  Data merged in: CVCL_5782

We are now introducing a new line type "AS" that will allow to store secondary
accession numbers(s). 

The format of the AS line is:

AS   accession_number[; accession_number]

Examples:
AS   CVCL_0116
AS   CVCL_B387; CVCL_Y092

We have retrofitted these secondary accession numbers to all merged entries
thus the "cellosaurus_deleted_ACs.txt" file now only contains the list of
accession numbers corresponding to entries that have been completely deleted
from the Cellosaurus.
