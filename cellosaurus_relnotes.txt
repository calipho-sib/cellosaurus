This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 34 of March 2020.

1) Statistics

118785 cell lines (88553 human, 20872 mouse, 2136 rat)
   671 species represented
 79419 synonyms
345031 cross-references to 89 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
112586 references to 19047 distinct publications (papers, patents, theses, etc.)
 20864 web links

  6927 human, mouse and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 496 distinct sources)

Since release 33 of December 2019:
  1151 entries were created
 54273 entries were updated

2) Change in the DI line: introduction of links to Orphanet Rare Disease
Ontology

Starting with this release cell lines that are originating from patients
suffering from a rare disease or that have been engineered to contain a
causal mutation for a rare disease are annotated with a disease line ("DI")
can now contain links to the the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO).

Note that the mapping of diseased cell lines to ORDO is not complete and is
expected to be finished in release 35.

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: ORDO
Name  : Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology
Server: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ordo
Db_URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ordo/terms?iri=http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/%s
Cat   : Ontologies

Example:
DI   ORDO; Orphanet_586; Cystic fibrosis

In the XML version the ORDO mappings are, like those to the NCIt in the
"<disease-list>". Example:

<disease-list>
  <cv-term terminology="NCIt" accession="C75463">Prader-Willi syndrome</cv-term>
  <cv-term terminology="ORDO" accession="Orphanet_739">Prader-Willi syndrome</cv-term>
</disease-list>

3) Changes in the CC lines

Introduction of a new topic: "Karyotypic information".

Examples:
CC   Karyotypic information: Haploid except for a disomy of chromosome 8.
CC   Karyotypic information: Has lost chromosome Y.
CC   Karyotypic information: Triploid karyotype.
