This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 22 of May 2017.

1) Statistics

 83000 cell lines (69593 human, 6411 mouse, 1818 rat)
   564 species represented
 40305 synonyms
173988 cross-references to 66 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 60511 references to 13378 distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
 10198 web links

  5014 human cell lines with STR profiles (from 168 distinct sources)

2) Changes in the ST lines

2a) Introduction of STR markers for dog cell lines.

Starting with this release we will capture STR marker information relevant to
dog cell lines. In a first instance we are introducing 10 markers: FHC2010,
FHC2054, FHC2079, PEZ1, PEZ3, PEZ5, PEZ6, PEZ8, PEZ12 and PEZ20.

We are prefixing these STR markers with the word "Dog" to insure that there is
no confusion with human STR markers. Example:

17CM98 (CVCL_0C82)

ST   Source(s): PubMed=27197945
ST   Dog FHC2010: 231
ST   Dog FHC2054: 156
ST   Dog FHC2079: 271
ST   Dog PEZ1: 127
ST   Dog PEZ3: 121,131
ST   Dog PEZ5: 107
ST   Dog PEZ6: 176
ST   Dog PEZ8: 236,240
ST   Dog PEZ12: 270,274
ST   Dog PEZ20: 176

3) Changes in the CC lines

3a) New "Derived for sampling site" CC line topic.

Introduction of the "Derived for sampling site" CC line topic. This is used
to indicate where a non-metastic cancerous cell line was isolated when it is
not directly from a solid tumor.

Examples:
CC   Derived from sampling site: Bone marrow.
CC   Derived from sampling site: Pleural effusion.

3b) New "Sequence variation" CC line topic.

Introduction of the "Sequence variation" CC line topic. This is used to store
information relevant to mutations (somatic or genomic) that are important to
describe in the context of cancers and genetic diseases.

Examples:
CC   Sequence variation: Heterozygous for BRAF p.Val600Glu (ATCC).
CC   Sequence variation: Homozygous for CFTR p.Phe508del (Coriell).
CC   Sequence variation: CBS c.1149-1226del (exon 11 del) (PubMed=8528202).
CC   Sequence variation: Has a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the 1st intron of C9orf72.

4) Changes in the DR lines

4a) Cross-references were added to the Colorectal Cancer Atlas (ColonAtlas).

4d) The cross-references to the LINCS Harvard Medical School center cell
lines pages have been renamed from "LINCS" to "LINCS_HMS".

Example:
DR   LINCS; 51088
is now:
DR   LINCS_HMS; 51088

4e) Cross-references were added to the NCI Development Therapeutics Program
(NCI-DTP) repository of tumor and tumor cell lines.
