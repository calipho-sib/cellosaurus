This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 21 of March 2017.

1) Statistics

 81458 cell lines (68405 human, 6299 mouse, 1800 rat)
   561 species represented
 37334 synonyms
169329 cross-references to 62 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 57308 references to 12955 distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
  9808 web links

  4824 human cell lines with STR profiles (from 151 distinct sources)

1) Changes concerning references on the ExPASy version

On ExPASy we have created specific reference pages for the references that
are cited in the Cellosaurus and that do not exist in PubMed, do not have a
DOI and  are not patents. These are the references tagged with a "CelloPub"
ID (for example: CelloPub=CLPUB00298). These page are available at the URL:

http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/cellopub/%s

where %s is the CelloPub number. Example:

http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/cellopub/CLPUB00298

2) Changes in the DR lines

Cross-references were added to the BioSamples database at EBI.

Abbrev: BioSamples
Name  : BioSamples database
Server: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/
Db_URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/%s
Cat   : Biological sample resources

Example:
DR   BioSamples; SAMEA3303029

Note that EBI BioSamples is distinct from NCBI BioSample for which we already
provide cross-references. In theory both resources should exchange their
sample entries and one would need to only provide cross-references to one of
them. Currently the exchange of data is not yet complete and the information
content is different between the two resources so we decided to implement
cross-references to EBI Biosamples for all samples with accession numbers
starting with "SAMEA" while we cross-reference to NCBI BioSample for all
samples with accession numbers starting with "SAMN".
