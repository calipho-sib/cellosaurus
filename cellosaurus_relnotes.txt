   805 species represented
105155 synonyms
417199 cross-references to 102 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
150310 references to 25963 distinct publications (papers, patents, theses, etc.)

  8472 human, mouse and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 787 distinct sources)

Since release 43 of September 2022:
  2689 entries were created
 11206 entries were updated

2) Changes in the CC lines

2a) New "Donor information" CC line topic.

Miscellaneous information regarding the donor of the cell line which was formerly found
in the "Miscellaneous" CC line type is now stored in a new CC line type "Donor information".

Examples:
CC   Donor information: At sampling donor was not affected with Alzheimer disease but has a 25% risk.
CC   Donor information: Established from the non-affected skin biopsy from an individual with multiple tumours of independent histological origin (PubMed=23093295).
CC   Donor information: Established from an unaffected member of a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family.

2b) New "Senescence" CC line topic.

Information regarding finite cell line senescence which was formerly found in the
"Characteristics" CC line type is now stored in a new CC line type: "Senescence".

Examples:
CC   Senescence: Senesces at 18 PDL (PubMed=12077343).
CC   Senescence: Has an extended life span, but it is not sure if it is immortal.
CC   Senescence: Can only be cultured for up to 15 passages before displaying signs of senescence (PubMed=26891694).

2c) New "Virology" CC line topic.

Information regarding the susceptibility of a cell line to viral infection, the presence
of integrated viruses or any other virology-related information which were all formerly
found in the "Characteristics" CC line type are now stored in a new CC line type:
"Virology".

Examples:
CC   Virology: Susceptible to infection and early propagation by guinea pig adenovirus (GPAdV) (PubMed=32226606).
CC   Virology: Infection by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in apoptotic cell death (PubMed=12441076).
CC   Virology: Used for differentiation of virulent and non virulent strains of measles virus (ECACC; IZSLER).

3) Changes concerning cross-references

3a) Cross-references were added to the NCBI database of Genotypes and Phenotypes
(dbGAP).

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: dbGAP
Name  : Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes
Server: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/
Db_URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=%s
Term. : No
Cat   : Sequence databases
//

Example:
DR   dbGAP; phs001839.v1.p1

3b) Cross-references were added to the PubChem Cell line pages.

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: PubChem_Cell_line
Name  : PubChem compound database; cell line pages
Server: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
Db_URL: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cell/%s
Term. : No
Cat   : Chemistry resources
//

Example:
DR   PubChem_Cell_line; CVCL_8337

4) Changes in the XML file

The descriptions of the elements "genome-ancestry" and "hla-typing-list"
(formerly called "hla-lists") were slightly changed so as to make the
representation of these data fields more homogeneous with that of other
fields.
