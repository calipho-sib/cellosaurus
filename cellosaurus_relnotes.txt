This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 23 of August 2017.

1) Statistics

 87309 cell lines (71518 human, 8159 mouse, 1890 rat)
   567 species represented
 42972 synonyms
178442 cross-references to 70 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 63273 references to 13968 distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
 12603 web links

  5057 human and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 186 distinct sources)

2) Changes in the CC lines

2a) New "Monoclonal antibody isotype" CC line topic.

Introduction of the "Monoclonal antibody isotype" CC line topic. This is
used to indicate the immunoglobulin isotype of the monoclonal antibody
(mAB) produced by a cell line. This topic applies to hybridoma (except
T-cell hybridoma) and to a number of transformed cell lines that produce
mABs.

Examples:
CC   Monoclonal antibody isotype: IgG2b, kappa.
CC   Monoclonal antibody isotype: IgM.

3) Changes in the DR lines

3a) Cross-references were added to the AddexBio cell line products.

4) Change in the ST lines

A new STR marker has been added: DYS391

For its description see:

Example:
ST   DYS391: 12

5) New file in the FTP distribution

contains a number of tables that list cell names with identical names
taking into account casing, punctuation signs and synonyms.
