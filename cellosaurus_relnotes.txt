This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 25 of March 2018.

1) Statistics

101528 cell lines (74534 human, 19137 mouse, 1908 rat)
   590 species represented
 56610 synonyms
203181 cross-references to 73 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 83338 references to 15116 distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
 12928 web links

  5429 human and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 273 distinct sources)

2) Introduction of the AG line

With this release we have introduced a new line type (AG) that allows to
store information on the age of the cell line donor at sampling.

Currently the information in this new line can either be textual or numerical.

Examples of textual AG lines:

AG   Age unspecified
AG   Adult
AG   Blastocyst stage
AG   Fetus

In the case where numerical data is available, it is postfixed with the
following period symbols:

Y   Year
M   Month
W   Week
D   Day
FY  Fetal year
FM  Fetal month
FW  Fetal week
FD  Fetal day 

Examples:

AG   43Y
AG   4M
AG   2FW 

Age values can include two period symbols. Examples:

AG   1Y10M
AG   2M17D

Age values can also be in a range. Examples:

AG   12-13FW
AG   80-81Y 

Age values can be prefixed by "<" or ">". Examples:

AG   <5M
AG   >10Y 

Important notes

- We have not finished retrofiting the age information in all Cellosaurus
  cell line entries. Currently about 72% of the entries contain age
  information.
- At a later stage we will add to the AG line cross-references to
  developmental ontologies.
- The age information is not available in the OBO format file.

3) Changes in the DR lines

3a) Cross-references were added to the Imanis Life Sciences cell line
products.

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: Imanis
Name  : Imanis Life Sciences cell line products
Server: https://www.imanislife.com/collections/cell-lines/
Db_URL: https://www.imanislife.com/?s=%s
Cat   : Cell line collections

Example:
DR   Imanis; CL023

3b) Merging of the IFO cross-references to JCRB.

As the Institute for Fermentation Osaka (IFO) cell lines are all distributed
by JCRB we decided to change the cross-references to these cell lines to that
of JCRB.

Example:
DR   IFO; IFO50416
is now:
DR   JCRB; IFO50416

4) Changes in the SX line 

We have changed one of the allowed label for the SX line: "Sex undetermined"
was changed to "Sex unspecified".
