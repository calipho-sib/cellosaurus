This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 30 of May 2019.

1) Statistics

112983 cell lines (84432 human, 19675 mouse, 2075 rat)
   625 species represented
 73553 synonyms
331707 cross-references to 85 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
104057 references to 17422 distinct publications (papers, patents, theses, etc.)
 17769 web links

  6482 human, mouse and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 434 distinct sources)

2) Addition of a date/entry history line

Starting with this release we introduced a new line type ("DT") which provides
information on when a Cellosaurus entry was created, when it was last updated
and which version of the entry is currently available.

In the text version of the Cellosaurus, the format of the DT line is the
following:

DT   Created: DD-MM-YY; Last updated: DD-MM-YY; Version: nn

Examples:
DT   Created: 06-06-12; Last updated: 07-09-18; Version: 5
DT   Created: 22-10-12; Last updated: 13-11-18; Version: 11

The DT line is mandatory. It is the last line of the entry before the "//"
termination line.

In the XML version of the Cellosaurus, the information on the DT line is
available using the following definition:

<xs:attribute name="created" type="xs:date" use="required"/>
<xs:attribute name="last_updated" type="xs:date" use="required"/>
<xs:attribute name="entry_version" type="xs:integer" use="required"/>

In the OBO version of the Cellosaurus only the date of creation of the
entry is indicated using the "creation_date" tag. Example:

creation_date: 2012-10-22T00:00:00Z

3) Changes in the CC lines

3a) Genome ancestry

Julie Dutil has accepted to make available in the Cellosaurus the data from
the ECLA (Estimated Cell Line Ancestry) tool (http://ecla.moffitt.org/)
developed by her group. Currently ECLA computes the estimated ancestry of about
1,400 cancer cell lines. This data is stored in a new CC line termed
"Genome ancestry".

In the text version of the Cellosaurus, the format of this CC line is the
following:

CC   Genome ancestry: African=x1%; Native American=x2%; East Asian, North=x3%; East Asian, South=x4%; South Asian=x5%; European, North=x6%; European, South=x7% (Reference_or_Xref).

Example:
CC   Genome ancestry: African=0.21%; Native American=0.92%; East Asian, North=1.76%; East Asian, South=0.01%; South Asian=1.21%; European, North=67.1%; European, South=28.8% (PubMed=30894373).

4) Changes in the DR lines

4a) Cross-references were added to the China Center for Type Culture
Collection.

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: CCTCC
Name  : China Center for Type Culture Collection
Server: http://www.cctcc.org/
Db_URL: None
Cat   : Cell line collections

Example:
DR   CCTCC; GDC057

4b) Cross-references were added to the Iranian Biological Research Center
(IBRC) cell line collection.

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: IBRC
Name  : Iranian Biological Research Center cell line collection
Server: http://www.ibrc.ir
Db_URL: None
Cat   : Cell line collections

Example:
DR   IBRC; C10001

4c) Change in the abbreviation of a cross-reference

The IPD-IMGT/HLA database was previously abbreviated IMGT/HLA.

Example:
DR   IMGT/HLA; 10074
Is now:
DR   IPD-IMGT/HLA; 10074

5) Change in the ST lines: introduction of STR markers for mouse cell lines

Starting with this release we will capture STR marker information relevant to
mouse cell lines. In a first instance we are introducing 19 markers: STR 1-1,
STR 1-2, STR 2-1, STR 3-2, STR 4-2, STR 5-5, STR 6-4, STR 6-7, STR 7-1,
STR 8-1, STR 9-2, STR 11-2, STR 12-1, STR 13-1, STR 15-3, STR 17-2, STR 18-3,
STR 19-2 and STR X-1

We are prefixing these STR markers with the word "Mouse" to insure that there
is no confusion with human STR markers. Example:

ST   Source(s): NIST
ST   Mouse STR 1-1: 10,15
ST   Mouse STR 1-2: 13
ST   Mouse STR 11-2: 15
ST   Mouse STR 12-1: 19
ST   Mouse STR 13-1: 15
ST   Mouse STR 15-3: 20.3
ST   Mouse STR 17-2: 12,15
ST   Mouse STR 18-3: 17,21
ST   Mouse STR 19-2: 12
ST   Mouse STR 2-1: 9
ST   Mouse STR 3-2: 14
ST   Mouse STR 4-2: 19.3
ST   Mouse STR 5-5: 13,15
ST   Mouse STR 6-4: 15.3
ST   Mouse STR 6-7: 12,15
ST   Mouse STR 7-1: 25.2,29
ST   Mouse STR 8-1: 15,16
ST   Mouse STR X-1: 26,27
