This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 29 of February 2019.

1) Statistics

110948 cell lines (83151 human, 19550 mouse, 1985 rat)
   609 species represented
 72261 synonyms
328753 cross-references to 83 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 98321 references to 16699 distinct publications (papers, patents, theses, etc.)
 17125 web links

  6130 human and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 399 distinct sources)

2) Changes in the CC lines

2a) New cross-references in the "Knockout cell" and "Transfected with" CC
topics.

In addition to FlyBase, HGNC, MGI, RGD and UniProtKB, these two topics now
also accept cross-references to the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee
Database (VGNC).

Examples:
CC   Knockout cell: Method=CRISPR/Cas9; VGNC; 37431; ABCB1.
CC   Transfected with: VGNC; 30323; Bovine ITGAV.
