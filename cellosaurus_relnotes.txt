This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 24 of November 2017.

1) Statistics

 90021 cell lines (72395 human, 18957 mouse, 1901 rat)
   573 species represented
 54477 synonyms
196890 cross-references to 73 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 76749 references to 14421 distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
 12530 web links

  5247 human and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 226 distinct sources)

2) Changes in the CC lines

2a) Changes in the format of the 'Misspelling' CC topic.

This topic is now structured. Misspelled names are no longer quoted using "'"
and the format of this comment is now:

CC   Misspelling: misspelled_name; free_text_comment.

Examples:

CC   Misspelling: Occasionally 'AHR 77'.
becomes:
CC   Misspelling: AHR 77; Occasionally.

CC   Misspelling: 'D24.7' in PubMed=11351043.
becomes:
CC   Misspelling: D24.7; In PubMed=11351043.

Another facet of the change is that oly one misspelled name is now allowed
per 'Misspelling' comment.

Example:
CC   Misspelling: Occasionally 'CACOV-3' or 'CaCOV3'.
becomes:
CC   Misspelling: CACOV-3; Occasionally.
CC   Misspelling: CaCOV3; Occasionally.

2b) New cross-references in the 'Selected for resistance to' CC topic.

In addition to ChEBI, PubChem and UniProtKB, this topic now also accepts
cross-references to DrugBank.

Example:
CC   Selected for resistance to: DrugBank; DB00002; Cetuximab (Erbitux).
