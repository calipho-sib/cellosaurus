This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 39 of September 2021.

1) Statistics

130952 cell lines (97714 human, 22740 mouse, 2493 rat)
   741 species represented
 93693 synonyms
389462 cross-references to 95 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
135305 references to 22861 distinct publications (papers, patents, theses, etc.)
 13576 web links

  7956 human, mouse and dog cell lines with STR profiles (from 647 distinct sources)

Since release 38 of May 2021:
  2154 entries were created
 15049 entries were updated

2) Changes in the DR lines

2a) Cross-references were added to the SUM Breast Cancer Cell Line Knowledge
Base (SLKBase). This resource contains information not only on the SUM series
of cell lines but on many other breast cancer cell lines.  

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: SLKBase
Name  : SUM Breast Cancer Cell Line Knowledge Base  
Server: https://sumlineknowledgebase.com/
Db_URL: https://sumlineknowledgebase.com/?page_id=%s
Cat   : Cell line databases/resources

Example:
DR   SLKBase; 241

2b) The NIH AIDS Reagent Program (NIH-ARP) has transitioned to become NIH HIV
Reagent Program (HIVReagentProgram). We have thus renamed the cross-references
to the new designation and are cross-referencing to the new site.

Corresponding entry in the file cellosaurus_xrefs.txt:

Abbrev: HIVReagentProgram
Name  : NIH HIV Reagent Program
Server: https://www.hivreagentprogram.org/Home.aspx
Db_URL: https://www.hivreagentprogram.org/Catalog/HRPCellLinesUninfected/%s.aspx
Cat   : Cell line collections

Example:
DR   HIVReagentProgram; ARP-4407

2c) CCLE cross references will be removed at the next release

Because the data of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) is now
completely integrated in the Dependency Map (DepMap) portal and that
links that goes to the original CCLE web site are now redirected to
DepMap we will remove these extraenous cross-references in release 40.

3) New version of the cellosaurus.xsd file

As announced in the last release we have completely restructured our
sequence variation annotations. With this release, these changes are
fully supported in the XML format of the Cellosaurus and this required
some in depth changes to the corresponding XSD file.
