This is the release notes for Cellosaurus version 20 of December 2016.

1) Statistics

 80666 cell lines (67725 human, 6232 mouse, 1790 rat)
   558 species represented
 35950 synonyms
166481 cross-references to 61 ontologies, databases, catalogs, etc.
 53942 references to 12439 distinct publications (papers, patents, thesis, etc.)
  9012 web links

  4760 human cell lines with STR profiles (from 140 distinct sources)

2) Distribution of the Cellosaurus in the XML format

Starting with this release we are providing the Cellosaurus in the XML
format in addition to the text and OBO formats.

There are two new files on the FTP directory for the Cellosaurus at:

ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/cellosaurus

These files are:

cellosaurus.xml: The XML file for the Cellosaurus
cellosaurus.xsd: The XML schema definition file for the Cellosaurus.

3) Changes in the CC lines

3a) Introduction of the "Doubling time" CC line topic.

We have introduced a new CC topic, "Doubling time", to store information on
the population doubling time of cell lines.

Examples:
CC   Doubling time: ~40 hours (DSMZ).
CC   Doubling time: 39 hours (DTP); 40-60 hours (DSMZ).
CC   Doubling time: 53 hours (PubMed=20176655).

3b) Introduction of the "Microsatellite instability" CC line topic.

We have introduced a new CC topic, "Microsatellite instability", to store
information relevant to the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) of
human cancer cell lines. MSI is characterized by the expansion or contraction
of DNA repeat tracts as a consequence of DNA mismatch repair deficiency.

Examples:
CC   Microsatellite instability: Stable (MSS/MSI-S).
CC   Microsatellite instability: Instable (MSI-High).

3c) Introduction of the "Characteristics" CC line topic.

Quite a number of comments of the type "Miscellaneous" have been moved to a
new CC topic that describes a cell line "characteristics".

Examples:
CC   Characteristics: A mutation in GBF1 is responsible for BFA resistance.
CC   Characteristics: IL3 dependent.
CC   Characteristics: Infected by Equine infectious anemia virus.
CC   Characteristics: Proliferates at the permissive temperature (32 Celsius) and has enhanced expression of a differentiated Sertoli cell phenotype at the restrictive temperature (40-41 Celsius).

3d) Introduction of the "Anecdotal" CC line topic.

We introduced the "Anecdotal" CC topic for a variety of information items
that are of an anecdotal nature and moved some of the "Miscellaneous"
comments into that new topic.

Examples:
CC   Anecdotal: First arthropod cell line to be established.
CC   Anecdotal: Cell line name is derived from the cat name 'Cocca'.
CC   Anecdotal: The HeLa cell line which was established in February 1951 is the oldest human immortal cell line.

3e) Introduction of the "Biotechnology" CC line topic.

We introduced the "Biotechnology" CC topic to describe the use of a cell line
in a biotechnological context and moved some of the "Miscellaneous" comments
into that new topic.

Examples:
CC   Biotechnology: Used in a bioassay for the determination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in environmental and food samples.
CC   Biotechnology: Used for the production of the Purified Vero-cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV) (Trade name: Verorab).

4) Changes in the DR lines

5) Changes in the OX lines

Up to this release we were using a small number of NCBI taxonomy terms that
specifically described hybrid cells. For example:

OX   NCBI_TaxID=129429; ! Mouse/rat hybrid cell lines

But these taxonomy terms were not available for all combination of hybrid
cells that are stored in the Cellosaurus and their use complexifies the
procees of computationally extracting the parent species of an hybrid cell
line. We therefore decided to standardize the "OX" representation of all
hybrid cell lines by having in all cases as many OX lines as there are
parent species. In the example above, we now have:

OX   NCBI_TaxID=10090; ! Mus musculus
OX   NCBI_TaxID=10116; ! Rattus norvegicus

This change has no impact on the format of the ASCII or OBO versions of the
Cellosaurus.
