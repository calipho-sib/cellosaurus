AB   Yes
A new cell line was established from Trichoplusia ni fat body in Excell
400 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. The maximum cell density reached
2.2x10^6 cells mL and the population doubling time was 22.9 h for this cell
line. The cell line was highly sensitive to AcMNPV, and produced 86
occlusion bodies per cell. The expression levels for two recombinant
proteins, beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, in this cell line
were compared to that in IPLB-Sf-21 and BTI-5B1. The activities of beta-
galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase from the novel cell line were (225.5
+- 13.4) IU mL and (4.7 +- 0.61) IU mL respectively. The expression levels
from the fat body cells and from BTI-TN-5B1, which is known to express
recombinant proteins at the highest levels, were almost the same and the
former was a little bit better. The new cell line can efficiently support
the expression of foreign protein and is designated as HNU-Tn-FB1.

AB   Yes
A new insect cell line, NEAU-Xc-960716H, was established from Xestia
c-nigrum larval hemocytes through successive passage over 70 generations
since July 1996. The cells were classified into two types: spherical and
spindle. The population doubling time of the cell line was about 63 hours.
The chromosomes were condensed short rods and round, typical in
lepidopteran cell lines. The isozyme pedigree of esterase was different
from the embryonic cell lines NEAU-Xc-730E of Xestia c-nigrum and IPLB-SF-21.
The cell line was susceptible to Xestia c nigrum nuclear polyhedrosis
virus (XcNPV), although at a low level.

AB   Yes
An embryo cell line of Bombyx mori, named BmE-SWU2, was established after
one year primary culture. The cells are relatively single, short shuttle-
like or round, and very small in shape. The cell line belongs to adhesive-
type epithelium. The cell doubling time was 51.8 h. The ratio of duple
cells was 89.76%. Thus, the cell line belongs to duple cell line. The
chromosomes of BmE-SWU2 was typical of Lepidoptera, namely the chromosomes
in metaphase were short pole-like or granule-like and the centromeres
dispersed-type. BmE-SWU2 was more sensitive to BmNPV. The 50% tissue
culture infection dose (TCID50) was 1.581x10^-7.

AB   Yes
The development of insect cell lines plays a significant role in research
and application of virology and entomology. Two new cell lines, i.e.,
QB-Ha-E-1 and QB-Ha-E-5, were established from the embryonic tissue of
Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The cell lines had been
subcultured over 60 passages in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Each cell line has two major morphological types, round
cells and spindle-shaped cells. DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF)
analysis indicated that DNA profiles of the two cell lines were similar
but distinctly different from cell lines of several other insects,
suggesting that both originated from the embryonic tissue of H. armigera.
The cell doubling time of the 30th passages of QB-Ha-E-1 and QB-Ha-E-5
were 63.7 h and 66.9 h, respectively. Both the cell lines could be
infected by H. armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) with the
infection rates of 86.6% and 56.5%, respectively, 4 d post infection (p.i.).
Approximately 15% of the two cell lines were infected by Mamestra
brassicae nucleopolyhedrovirus (MbNPV) 7 d p.i. The two cell lines had
differential responses to Autographa californica multiple
nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) infection. The results from the fluorescent
staining with DAPI and electrophoresis of genomic DNA indicated that
QB-Ha-E-5 cell line had typical apoptotic response following AcMNPV infection,
but QB-Ha-E-1 cell line, with the AcMNPV infection rate of 55.3%, appeared
anti-apoptosis. Actinomycin D could induce apoptosis of the two cell lines
at the concentration of 1.25 mug/mL. Therefore, the two cell lines can be
used as ideal materials to study interactions between insect viruses and
insect cells.

The development of new cell lines from unusual and non-pest species may
provide important source for basic research and biotechnology application.
In this study, three new insect cell lines designated as QB-Ms1-8, QB-Ms2-2,
and QB-Ms2-7, respectively, were established from eggs of Manduca sexta.
These cells were subcultured approximately 50 passages in TNM-FH medium at
28 Celsius. The majority of cells of the lines generally are spindle-
shaped. The population doubling time of QB-Ms1-8, QB-Ms2-2 and QB-Ms2-7
cells was 51, 31 and 49 h, respectively. Although these lines were
insusceptible to Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis
virus (AcMNPV) with the infection rate of 33%-40% at 96 h post infection,
QB-Ms2-2 cell line showed higher level of secreted SEAP production in
comparison with BTI-Tn5B1-4 cell line. In this study, a SEAP high
expression type cell line, QB-M2-2 was isolated from the three new cell
lines established from M. sexta, which may provide a source for searching
novel clones with higher production of recombinant proteins.

AB   Yes
A monocytoid cell line (KP-MO-TS) has been established from the peripheral
blood of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL). The cells,
showing monoblastoid or promonocytoid morphology, expressed CD15, CD33,
CD4 and HLA-DR antigens. Retinoic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-
acetate induced maturation of the cells into monocytoid or macrophage-like
cells. The expression of CD11b and/or CD13 and an increase in phagocytic
activity accompanied the morphological differentiation. Cytogenetic
studies revealed t(10;11)(p13:q21), the same abnormality initially found
in the patient's leukemic blasts. Immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa gene was
rearranged, however, the IgH gene, T cell-receptor beta and gamma genes
showed germ line configuration. This cell line may be useful in
investigating the biological features and the pathogenesis of monocytic
leukemia possessing a breakpoint at 11q21-23.

AB   Yes
There are several methods for assay of in vitro drug sensitivity of
cultured cancer cells. The present study first deals with the validity of
two representative methods of in vitro sensitivity tests: the growth
inhibition method expressed by a sensitivity index of IC50 (50% inhibition
concentration) and the regrowth assay method expressed by an index of LD90
(90% lethal dose). The regrowth assay method has been confirmed to be
highly reproducible and the sensitivity index of LD90 is not influenced by
the inoculation size of test cells, the day judged, and the population
doubling time of test cells. Therefore, the drug sensitivity among cell
lines could be evaluated by comparing their indices. On the other hand,
the IC50 is not reproducible and influenced by the 3 factors above
mentioned. Therefore, it might be concluded that IC50 is not suitable as
an index of sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs at least in
terms of cytocidal activity. Secondly, the result of sensitivity tests of
9 human stomach cancer cell lines to mitomycin C measured by regrowth
assay is reported. In general, cell lines derived from poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma are more sensitive to the test drug than
those from well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma.

AB   Yes
A new cultured cell line (ACL-15) was established from a transplantable
rat colon cancer strain induced by 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (DMH).
Histologically, the primary colonic tumor was a poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma; all transplanted tumors showed the same histologic
features. The doubling time of the ACL-15 cell line population was 24 h,
and the saturation density was 5.6x10^5 cells/cm2 in culture. The
chromosome number and DNA content of the ACL-15 cells were near tetraploid.
ACL-15 cells frequently metastasized to the liver and lungs in vivo.
Thirty percent of those rats inoculated with ACL-15 cells into the
subserosa of the cecum and all rats which received intrasplenic
inoculations of ACL-15 cells developed hepatic metastases. All rats
injected with ACL-15 into subcutis and into the tail vein developed
multiple pulmonary metastases. This newly established cell line, ACL-15,
can serve for a model of metastatic colonic cancer.

AB   Yes
Two human myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines highly resistant to 1-beta-D-
arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) were established. One line, designated KY-Ra,
has been proliferating with 1x10^-4 M ara-C for over one year. The
other one, KY-Rb, has proliferated with 1x10-5 M N^4-behenoyl-1-beta-D-
arabinofuranosylcytosine (BH-AC) after it reached a proliferative capacity
with 1x10^-6 M ara-C. These two ara-C-resistant cell lines have shown
approximately 5,900 fold and 18,000 fold resistance to ara-C over the
parental KY-821 cell line. The deoxycytidine kinase activity of each cell
line was 0.39 (dCMP/min/mug protein) for KY-Ra, 0.26 for KY-Rb, 1.23 for
KY-821. Deoxycytidine deaminase activities were almost identical. In drug
accumulations, ara-C resistant cell lines showed a reduced uptake of ara-C
during a 4 h exposure to 1 nM ara-C. After loading almost the same
intracellular contents of drugs, ara-CTP accumulation decreased in two ara-C
resistant cell lines, and the efflux rate was increased in KY-Ra. These
results indicate that the decreased deoxycytidine kinase activity, which
resulted in a decreased ara-CTP accumulation, is one of major mechanisms
of the resistance, and suggest the possibility that an increase of the
outward flux of ara-C is one mechanism of resistance. These cell lines may
be useful for studying the refractoriness encountered in ara-C
administration.

We have established two adriamycin (ADM)-resistant sublines with different
levels of drug resistance, MKN45R0.05 and MKN45R0.8, from the parental
MKN45 human gastric cancer cell line by exposure to stepwise increases in
ADM. MKN45R0.05 and MKN45R0.8 cells were 4.8-and 15-fold more resistant to
ADM than MKN45 cells, respectively. Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis
revealed that MKN45R0.8 cells had significantly lower accumulation of
cells in G_2M phase and higher efflux rate of intracellular ADM content
than MKN45 and MKN45R0.05 cells. There was no significant increase of
P-glycoprotein expression in both resistant sublines by FCM analysis.
Verapamil (VPM) showed stronger modifying effects on ADM sensitivity and
cell kinetics in MKN45R0.8 than MKN45R0.05 cells. These results indicate
that FCM analysis is useful for determining the level of drug resistance,
drug accumulation and P-glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, and that
the differential resistance-modifying activity of VPM depends on the level
of drug resistance.

A heterogeneitic human gastric cancer cell line was isolated and
established as a UMK-1 line. Eight clones were selected for studies on
morphology, growth pattern, cellular DNA and RNA contents and drug
sensitivity in comparison with those in parent cell line of UMK-1. There
were differences in morphology, growth pattern, saturation density,
cloning efficiency and cellular DNA and RNA contents among the 8 clones.
The drug sensitivity to mitomycine C (MMC), adriamycine (ADM) and cis-
diamindichloroplatinum (CDDP) varied in each of the clones although that
of UMK-1 line had been in-between them. Such is a reflection of a presence
of clonal heterogeneity. Selection of drugs time by time offers the
greatest effectiveness on tumor regression due to responses to accidental
loss of sensitivity to drugs used.

AB   Yes
In order to evaluate the proliferation and differentiation potentials of
ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-induced glioma cells, the author attempted to
obtain a cell line that maintains glial features in long term culture. One
of five cell lines cultivated from ENU-induced rat gliomas deserved
particular interest because of the differentiation of the neoplastic glia.
This cell line, designated as HITS glioma, had a polygonal cell body and
formed a monolayer with pile-up foci in vitro, in contrast to the other
cell lines, which showed a mesenchymal drift through passages. GFAP-
positive cells, found in the primary culture, disappeared in the late
passages of HITS glioma as they did in the other cell lines.
Galactocerebroside (GC) and GD3 ganglioside were not expressed in the cell
lines during culture. Subcutaneous inoculation of HITS glioma into
neonatal rats induced tumors with various histopathological components
mimicking the histopathological appearance of ENU-induced gliomas. The
components also had a fraction of GFAP-positive cells. These findings
indicate that HITS glioma cells may be composed of immature glial cells
and differentiate into astrocytic cells under certain conditions. Insulin-
like growth factor I (IGF-I), which promoted the proliferation of GFAP-
positive cells in neonatal glia, was used to evaluate the mechanism(s) of
proliferation and/or differentiation of HITS glioma. IGF-I did not induce
the expression of GFAP in HITS glioma, even though it promoted the
proliferation of HITS glioma. Although the mechanism involving the
astrocytic differentiation of HITS glioma is unknown, HITS glioma may
serve as a research tool in evaluating the mechanisms of proliferation and
differentiation of neoplastic glia.

Cultivation of human cancer in vitro provides an efficient tool for cancer
research and is very useful for morphological and biochemical analysis of
cancer at cellular level. Therefore, many attempts have been made to
culture human cancer cells, including adenocarcinoma cells of the
alimentary tract. However only a little success has been reported on the
establishment of human cancer cell line. This may be mainly due to some
technical difficulties for cultivation, e.g., bacterial and fungous
contaminations of inocula and overgrowth of normal fibroblasts as well as
macrophages in primary culture, and also adaptability of human cancer
cells in vitro. Taking these into consideration, the present authors have
tried to cultivate cancer cells from metastatic foci of 8 patients with
the primary colorectal carcinomas, and succeeded in long-term cultivation
of one rectal carcinoma. The present report deals with successful
establishment of a human rectal adenocarcinoma cell line (CaR-1) and its
characterization.

Gash, a cell line established from a 34 year old male with hairy cell
leukemia has been confirmed as a hairy cell leukemia line by electron
microscopy, surface and cytoplasmic markers and positive TRAP (tartrate
resistant acid phosphatase) stain. The cell line involves rather mature
B-cells. Cytogenetic analysis showed 79% of the cells to be
46,XY,del(6)(p23), 13% to be pseudotetraploid with an exact duplication of
the pseudodiploid cells, and 8% to have random abnormalities in addition
to the deleted 6p. Twenty-seven percent of the pseudodiploid and 50% of
the pseudotetraploid metaphases had telomere association, a tight end-to-
end association of chromosomes, with one to three per metaphase. The
chromosomes involved appeared to be random with most chromosomes
represented. All but one association involved non-homologous chromosomes;
the only homologous telomeres associated were two 17p's in a tetraploid
cell. That these were in some cases more than transient contacts of
chromosomes was evidenced by the presence of rare cells (8%) with
translocations, fragments and terminal deletions--such abnormalities as
might result from breakage of a dicentric during division. Telomere
association has been reported previously in preparations from four
malignancies; two B-cell ALL, one T-cell ALL and one malignant fibrous
histiocytoma. It has also been reported in senescent fibroblasts, SV40
transformed cells and rare syndromes. The high frequency of telomere
association in this hairy cell leukemia line offers a unique opportunity
to study telomere association.

AB   Yes
Concomitant with progressive loss of lymphocytoid structure during
repeated mouse passage, a methylcholanthrene-induced lymphoid neoplasm
(P388) acquired increased ability to survive in vitro, where it changed
morphologically to a reticulum cell sarcoma capable of continuous
cultivation. Originating in a DBA/2 mouse as a neoplasm clearly
lymphocytic in structure, P388 was converted to ascitic form in the first
mouse transfer. At the sixth mouse passage, alternate passage of cells
through tissue culture and mouse was started, continuing through 17 cycles.
During these culture attempts, the lymphoid character of the neoplasm was
preserved with only slight variation, as observed both in vivo and in
vitro. Maximum in vitro sunival time in these passages was 17 days. A
second set of culture trials was carried out with cells from the 47th and
later consecutive mouse passages. Here it was found that (1) the structure
of P388 cells in vivo had altered toward a cell type corresponding to an
atypical hemocyto-blast, and (2) the in vitro survival time of these cells
had increased to upwards of 30 days. P388 cells taken from the 49th
consecutive mouse passage were maintained in one culture for 51 days.
During this period, neoplastic cells underwent morphologic alteration to a
larger, more ameboid form containing many cytoplasmic vacuoles. The
ascitic cells emerging from intraperitoneal inoculation of this culture
into mice showed a correspondingly altered structure. They were much
larger and more vacuolated, and many multinucleated forms were present.
Cells isolated directly on glass from the ascites of this animal have been
cultivated continuously for months, through four serial subcultures. In
vitro, the "derived" line (P388D1) shows much pleomorphism with many
spindle, stellate, multilobular, and multi-nucleated forms. These cells
actively phagocytize carbon particles and in general behave as reticulum

conversion of P388 into a reticulum cell sarcoma has been repeated twice,
the "derived" lines in the three instances showing characteristics
differing only slightly from one another, and all three being thus far
continuously cultivated.

AB   Yes
HBME-1 monoclonal antibody has recently become available as a
suggested immunohistochemical tool for the positive identification of
malignant mesothelioma. In this study, the HBME-1 antibody was
immunohistochemically evaluated on selected normal tissues and in 540
epithelial and nonepithelial tumors of different organs. Most
mesotheliomas (25 of 29) showed a strong reactivity, with either a
luminal or a cytoplasmic pattern. However, less differentiated
mesotheliomas with sarcomatous features as well as sarcomatous areas
of otherwise more differentiated mesotheliomas were negative. With
regard to carcinomas, about half of the adenocarcinomas of the lung
showed reactivity that was usually less conspicuous than the
reactivity observed in mesothelioma. Consistently positive
adenocarcinomas included endometrial and ovarian serous carcinomas.
Thyroid lesions reacted differently: papillary and follicular
carcinomas were strongly positive, whereas follicular adenomas and
normal tissues were usually negative, suggesting that HBME-1 may be
helpful in the evaluation of thyroid lesions. While gastric and
pancreatic adenocarcinomas showed positivity in a minority of cases,
tumors from the breast only rarely showed significant reactivity.
Adenocarcinomas of colon, kidney, and prostate were almost invariably
negative. Among soft-tissue and bone tumors, chordoma and
cartilaginous tumors were strongly positive, and synovial sarcoma
showed reactivity in the epithelial component. Other sarcomas and
melanomas were negative. On the basis of our findings, HBME-1
monoclonal antibody is helpful in the differential diagnosis of
mesothelioma, but because adenocarcinomas of many sites, including
lung, are sometimes strongly positive, this antibody has to be used
in a panel with other antibodies. We believe that the HBME-1 antibody
could replace one of the antibodies that is typically negative in
mesothelioma and positive in carcinoma. Interestingly, HBME-1 appears
to be useful in subtyping lesions of certain organs, primarily
thyroid tumors, soft-tissue and bone tumors of cartilaginous
differentiation, and those with epithelial traits.

AB   Yes
Polyamines (spermidine and spermine) and their precursor putrescine are
ubiquitous in biological systems. Prokaryotes have a higher concentration
of putrescine than of spermidine, and have no or little spermine. On the
other hand eukaryotic cells usually have little putrescine but significant
amounts of spermine as well as spermidine. Concentrations of these amines
were found to be elevated in rapidly proliferating tissues and to increase
when growth was induced. A close correlation between polyamines and
nucleic acid synthesis and content has been observed, and recent studies
using specific inhibitors of polyamine synthesis suggest that the amines
and specially spermidine are involved in these processes. Amphibian
embryos have putrescine and spermidine at higher concentrations than
spermine. An euploid cell line, XB694, was initiated by us from Xenopus
borealis embryos. We have measured the concentrations of putrescine and
spermidine, the synthesis of DNA and the activity of ornithine
decarboxylase (the enzyme that produces putrescine from ornithine) at two
stages of culture: log-phase (4 days) and plateau-phase (9 days). Culture
conditions were previously described. Contents in putrescine and
spermidine were determined by fluorimetry following HP-TLC chromatography
of DNS derivatives. Spermine was present as trace amount. The mean level
of putrescine was very high at log-phase (6.3 nmol/10^6 cells). At plateau-
phase it was reduced more than 9-fold (0.68 nmol/10^6 cells). Spermidine
level was 5.5 nmol/10^6 cells at log-phase and 2.16 nmol/10^6 cells at
plateau-phase, decreasing more slowly (2.5-fold). These differences were
repeatedly observed in other experiments. DNA synthesis was mesured after
a 6.5-h incorporation of 3H-TdR (0.3 muCi/ml; 23 Ci/mmol). PCA-insoluble
material displayed 46 850 +- 4687 cpm/10^6 cells at log-phase and 3 263 +-
284 cpm/10^6 cells at plateau-phase. Autoradiography of the two cell
preparations showed that 60.9% and 7.6% of the nuclei were labelled.
respectively. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was determined in situ.
Incubation mixtures contained 0.1 muCi [I-14C] DL-ornithine (56 mCi/mmol)
and 0.1 mM L-ornithine. Values obtained were 35 513 +- 3 361 cpm (log-
phase) and 5 509 +- 517 cpm (plateau-phase) per h per mg of protein.
Plateau-phase cells display still high putrescine content as compared to
other eukaryotic cells. A good correlation is observed between the levels
of putrescine and the percentage of 3H-TdR-labelled nuclei. The question
of a particular role of the diamine in the proliferation of XB694 cells is
currently under investigation.

The IB-RS-2 cell line derived from swine kidney, after two years and a
half of continuous cultivation, is described. This cell line has shown to
be useful for titration and isolation of the foot-and-mouth disease
virus, types A, O and C. The results obtained in sera-neutralization test
in this cell line run parallel to the results obtained in sera-protection
test in unweaned mice. It is also reported here that some batches of
primary cultures of bovine kidney "resistant" to several samples of the
types A, O and C may occur; this observation seems to limit the use of
this system. From several samples of the three types of virus tested in
IB-RS-2 cell line, one, type C, was an exception and showed to be unable to
induce CPE, in first passage, in this cell line. However, after the third
passage, it became "adapted". On the other hand, another sample, also
typed as C, to which the IB-RS-2 cell line was as susceptible as swine
kidney primary cultures, was not able to induce CPE, nor could it be
isolated In "normal" bovine kidney primary cultures which were
susceptible to other samples. Evidence was observed that a virus sample
with a high number of passages in IB-RS-2 cell line, became modified, as
far as pathogenicity to unweaned mice and 'capacity to induce CPE in
"normal" bovine primary cultures are concerned. The advantages of the use
of the IB-RS-2 cell line are: it grows actively in a relatively simple
and unexpensive medium, It is apparently free of contaminants, and
replicates can be prepared easily for experimental purposes at any time
desired.

AB   Yes
A continuation of the history of the swine kidney cell line, IB-RS-2, as
well as the evolution of its chromosome complement, from the 56th to the
154th cell transfers are given. Up to the 75th transfer, there was a
prevalence of cells with 37 centromeres belonging to 1.1 type (Table I).
After the recovery of the cultures from a dramatic cell necrosis, the
prevalent karyotypes had 38 centromeres. These karyotypes could be found
in the cell clones derived from the parental cell population. It would
appear that the seven clones which could be analysed are descendants of
cells with 38 chromosomes, type 2.2: two of them, C-12 and C-19 are type 2.2,
but C-19 presents a secondary constriction in one of the largest GIV-XX
chromosomes not found in C-12; five of them have a new large
subacrocentric chromosome (SA). C-16, C-17, C-18 and C-60 (karyotype 2.2.1)
have also a microchromosome which is not found in C-13 (karyotype 2.2.2)
It seems that these five clones had been originated from a cell of 2.2
karyotype, through a recombination between one of the largest GIV-XX and
one of the GVI chromosomes, giving rise to the large SA and to the
microchromosome. Afterwards, in C-13, this microchromosome was lost.

Hepatocytes isolated from an adult male Wistar rat were transfected with
plasmid pMTIOD containing the early region of simian virus 40 (SV40)
genome by using the electroporation method and a hepatocyte line,
designated RTH33, has been established from the transformed cells. The
presence of SV40 T antigen in the RTH33 cells showed that the cell line
resulted from the introduction of SV40 genetic information. RTH33 cells
were similar in morphology to the primary hepatocytes in monolayer culture.
The cells multiplied vigorously in a serum-containing medium and, as is
evident in the case of primary hepatocytes, the DNA synthesis was
stimulated by insulin and the epidermal growth factor (EGF). RTH33 cells
retained hepatocytic functions including albumin synthesis, urea
synthesis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis and glucuronidation of bilirubin
even after more than 100 passages over a period of 2 years. The cell line,
RTH33, is a useful and stable cell source not only for biological studies
of hepatocytes, but also in the development of bioartificial livers using
cultured hepatocytes, which is a promising therapeutic method in the case
of fulminant hepatic failure.

Primary cells cultures from catfish (Clarias batrachus) and snakeheads

Four methods were tried: method A wherein explants were placed onto the
surface of 25-cm^2 Primaria flasks (Falcon), allowed to attach for an hour
before addition of Leibovitz medium (L-15) supplemented with 15% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (L15-L15); Method B wherein explants were inoculated
into 25-cm^2 Primaria flasks (Falcon) already containing L15-15; Method C
which required forcing minced organ sections through a stainless steel
sieve with the aid of a syringe plunger into a Petri dish containing L15-15
medium; and Method D wherein immersed sections of minced tissues to 0.5%
trypsin-EDTA slowly agitated using a magnetic stirrer for one hour at
25 Celsius. Method B was most effective in the establishment of cell
cultures both fish species. Passage numbers of the cells are to date
catfish gonad (CFG) P-56, catfish heart (CFH) P-51, catfish kidney (CFK)

Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive tumor;
treatment remains a challenge because of the lack of effective therapeutic
strategies. Basic research in this field is dependent on the availability
of model systems. New pancreatic cancer cell lines are therefore important
for the study of its biology. In the present study, we report the
establishment and characterization of six new pancreatic cancer cell lines
(PaCaDD-141, -159, -161, -165, -183, -188).

Material and methods: All cell lines were derived from pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinomas by the Dresden outgrowth protocol. The six cell lines
originated from different sample locations. We characterized the cell
lines by examining their morphology and their cytostructural and
functional profiles.

Results: All cell lines were cultured in optimized Dresden-medium. The
doubling time ranged from 20 to 43 hours. KRAS mutations were detected in
four of the six cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining showed
cytoplasmic expression of CK8/18, mostly membrane and partially
cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin and strong expression of ezrin in all
cell lines. Three cell lines showed nuclear p53 accumulation and
heterogeneous expression of vimentin. SMAD4 was heterogeneously expressed
in the cell lines.

Conclusions: We were able to establish six new primary pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines. As applicable tools for basic research, these cell
lines might contribute to a better understanding and treatment of this
aggressive tumor.

Several cell lines were established from haploid lethal embryos of the
female-sterile mutant mh 1182 of Drosophila ntelanogaster. An
ultrastructural examination of these cell lines was carried out. In
particular, cells of the 1182-4 line were studied, using diploid Kc cells
as a reference. In Kc cells, a centriole is clearly recognizable in 5.5%
of the 2000 cell profiles examined at random. Centrioles, associated in
diplosomes, appear as very short cylinders of 0.16 muM in length and 0.20
muM in diameter. They consist of the classical 9 microtubule triplets and
are embedded in a cylinder of electron-dense material, 0.35 muM in
diameter. In the 1182-4 cell line, 4000 cell profiles were examined, and
none showed centrioles. In serial sections of the dividing cells, no
centrioles were found either at the spindle poles or elsewhere in the
cytoplasm. We conclude that centrioles are absent in most if not all cells
of the haploid 1182-4 cell line. Centrioles are also missing in a
spontaneously diploidized 1182-4 subline. Their absence is therefore not
directly linked to the haploid state of the cells. The present findings
confirm that centrioles are not obligatory organelles for the organization
of the spindle apparatus in metazoan cells. More importantly, this is the
first report on the existence of a metazoan cell line in which cells
regularly divide without a centriole.

AB   Yes
A continuonsly maintained cell line, RED-3, was successfully isolated from
the peripheral blood blasts of a 24 yo man with a TdT(+) acute leukemia in
relapse. The patient presented with a mediastinal mass and a WBC count of
30,000/mm3 with 24% blasts, which were lymphoblasts by morphology (FAB
class L2), TdT(+), polar block acid phosphatase (+), PAS (-), peroxidase
(-), nonspecific esterase (-), and 90% positive for E-rosette formation,
leading to a diagnosis of T-ALL. An initial complete remission was
achieved with vincristine, prednisone, daunomycin, and L-asparaginase. A
subsequent remission was achieved with the same drugs when the patient
relapsed 17 months after diagnosis. During a second relapse 9 mos later,
leukemic blasts were obtained for tissue culture after an unsuccessful
attempt to induce remission with mitoxantrone. Blasts were separated from
blood by Hypaque-Ficoll gradients and cultured at 10^6 cells/ml in RPMI
1640 supplemented with insulin, transferrin, selenium (ITS), 20% fetal
calf serum (FBS), and 10% PHA stimulated human lymphocyte conditioned
media (LCM). After 3 weeks' undisturbed incubation at 37 Celsius, 7% CO2,
additional media was added and then renewed weekly by demi-depletion with
gradual withdrawal of FBS and LCM. By 8 wks the cells were established in
RPMI and ITS alone with an average doubling time of 26 hrs and have been
maintained continuously since that time (>10 mos). Like the blast cells in
vivo, RED-3 cells in culture were found to be TdT(+) and polar block acid
phospatase(+). FACS analysis also showed them to be 86-96% positive for
the T-cell antigens, Leu 3a and Leu 3b. However, at the same time, these
cells were found to be histochemically positive for PAS, peroxidase, and
Sudan black and to be 85% positive for the myeloid antigen, Leu M1.
Moreover, when incubated with retinoic acid (10^-6M) or dimethylformamide
(6x10^-2M), the cells underwent myeloid maturation as assessed by
morphology, NBT reduction, and acquisition of the OKM1 antigen (78%+).
They also partially lost Leu 3 reactivity. The characteristics of this new
human leukemia cell line support previous reports that T-ALL lymphoblasts
or their precursors may retain a potential for myloid differentiation.

AB   Yes
Extremely aggressive transplantable leukemias were derived in mice
inoculated with a Friend virus isolate which was molecularly cloned,
replication-competent, and free of spleen focus-forming activity.
Assessment of the hormone-sensitivity of the leukemic spleen cella led to
the isolation of several continuous lines which survive only in the
presence of erythropoietin (EPO). These lines have been frozen, thawed and
passaged for more than one year without loss of the EPO requirement. Five
sources of EPO, including human (recombinant and urinary), sheep, and
murine EPO produced a dose-related stimulation of proliferation as
assessed by tritiated thymidine uptake. In contrast, interleukin-1 (IL-1),
IL-2, or IL-3 did not stimulate thymidine uptake. By light and electron-
microscopy the majority of the cells exhibited early eyrthroid morphology
although there was considerable heterogeneity with respect to cell size.
Approximately 15-30% of the cells wore similar in size to late
erythroblasts. Nevertheless, the cells were hemoglobin negative by
benzidine staining although low levels of globin mRNA could be detected by
hybridisation. Ten subclones derived from single cells were all EPO-
dependent and provided a sensitive, convenient, biological assay for the
hormone. The assay could reliably quantitate between 0.3 and 30 milliunits
of EPO with a half maximal response at 3 milliunits. In addition to their
practical implications, these observations raise the possibility that EPO
may not directly induce the synthesis of hemoglobin and other erythroid
proteins but rather may act as a viability agent to keep erythroid
progenitors alive while they differentiate. The results are discussed in
relation to an alternate model of development which suggests that
production of committed progenitors is continuous and that expansion of a
lineage is due to selection rather than induction.

A novel myeloma cell line, designated NOP-1, was established from the bone
marrow of a male patient with IgA-kappa type multiple myeloma. NOP-1 cells
grow in single-cell suspension with doubling time of 36 hours. NOP-1 cells
were uniformly positive for cytoplasmic and surface immunoglobuline (Ig) of
IgA-kappa and J-chain of IgA, but were negative for other classes of Ig.
Surface marker analysis by an indirect immunofluorescent technique
revealed the presence of CD4 and PCA-1 antigen. NOP-1 cells were uniformly
negative for Ia-like antigen, B cell specific antigens such as CD9, CD19,
CD20, CD21 and CC24, T cell specific antigens except CD4, myeloid,
erythroid and megakaryocyte-platelets specific antigens. NOP-1 cells
possessed no markers for E-rosette, C3 receptor and IgG- and IgM-Fc receptor.
Epstein-Barr virus associated nuclear antigen was negative in NOP-1 cells.
Culture supernatant contained human Ig of IgA-k. Chromosome analysis of
this cell line revealed a human male hyperdiploid karyotype with a modal
chromosome number of 74 to 76. NOP-1 cells were successfully transplanted
and have been maintained into untreated normal athymic nude mice (KSN).
After injection of 5x10^7 NOP-1 cells into intraperitoneal space,
sanguineous ascites developed in 100% of injected mice. This
transplantable cell line was designated NOP-1/nu and has been maintained
over 10 passages. This novel human myeloma cell line may provide a useful
model for the study of cell lineage of multiple myeloma and of
chemotherapeutic evaluation of multiple myeloma in vitro, and in vivo.

AB   Yes
Ki-1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a newly recognized
clinicopathologic entity characterized by a distinctive chromosome
translocation, t(2;5)(p23;q35), sinus and paracortical infiltration of
lymph nodes, frequent extra-nodal disease (especially skin, soft tissue,
CI tract and bone), and expression of lymphocyte activation antigens
(CD3O, CD25, transferrin receptor, and HLA-DR) by pleomorphic tumor cells.
Spontaneous regression of skin lesions is frequently encountered. The peak
age incidence of ALCL is childhood and adolescence. A good response to
chemotherapy (COMP or D-COMP) with an excellent event-free survival has
been reported for most patients with ALCL; however a subset of patients
have treatment resistant disease. To better understand the biology of ALCL
and to develop new approaches to therapy, we established a cell line from
leukemic cells of a 12 year old boy (JB) with treatment resistant disease.
The morphology of JB cells consists of a spectrum of small Sezary-like
cells and larger immunoblasts including multinucleated Reed-Sternberg like
cells. The immunophenotype is that of an activated T-cell: positive for
CD2, CD7, Bfl, CD30, CD25, transferrin receptor, CD45, HLA-DR and for the
histiocyte-macrophage marker KP-1. JB cells have the t(2;5) and clonal
rearrangement of beta chain T-cell receptor genes but germline
configuration of immunoglobulin JH gene. The cloning efficiency is 5% and
the doubling time is 60 hr in methylcellulose with IMDM and 15% FCS. JB
cells were injected intraperitoneally to form a metastasizing tumor in
SCID mice. The transplanted tumor maintains the original morphology,
immunophenotype and genotype. Tumor fragments have been passaged
repeatedly subcutaneously reaching a tumor size of greater than 1 cm in
4-6 weeks. The subcutaneous tumors remain outside the abdominal wall fascia
and do not metastasize. Preliminary experiments of tumor directed therapy
have been initiated. This cell line should provide a means of designing
more effective therapies for treatment-resistant Ki-1 + ALCL.

A biphenotypic myeloma cell line (Sa5) has been established from the bone

expressed myeloid markers including chloroacetate (specific) esterase and
CD33 (MY9) as well as plasma cell marker PCA-1. Morphologically, Sa5
showed extensive nuclear lobulation, and ultrastructural studies revealed
abundant perinuclear cytoplasmic fibrils. Southern blot analysis showed JK
gene rearrangement. Exogenous IL-6 enhanced proliferation of Sa5. Free
kappa chains could be detected in the supernatant of the culture medium.

have been cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum since December
1986. Recent studies proved the existence of hybrid or polyphenotypic
myeloma coexpressing myeloid, monocytic and plasma cell antigens (M.

AB   Yes
Attachment to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor as
an alternative to the use of a transmembrane region has been described
for a large number of membrane proteins including the complement control
proteins decay-accelerating factor (CD55) and membrane inhibitor of reactive
lysis (CD59) as well as the cell surface molecules CD48 and leucocyte
function antigen-3 (CD58). Those structures have been demonstrated to be
missing from the membrane of the abnormal blood cells in patients with
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Here we report on a similar
defect for GPI-anchored membrane proteins on a new human myeloma cell line
designated LOPRA-2 with the phenotype of terminally differentiated B cells
derived from peripheral blood of a patient with plasma cell leukemia. The
cultured cells secrete immunoglobulin molecules consisting of gamma1 heavy
and kappa light chains; they express the plasma cell antigen PCA-1, the
antigens CD28 (Kolt-2), CD38 (OKT10), CD56 (Leu19), CD71 (OKT9) and some
epitopes of the CD24 antigen (HB8, V1B E3), but are negative for surface
immunoglobulins, HLA class II antigens (HLA-DP, -DQ, -DR) and other B-cell
markers such as CD10 (CALLA), CD19 (B4), CD20 (B1), CD21 (B2), CD22 (HD39),
CD23 (MHM6), CD37 (BL14), and CD39 (G28-8) as analyzed by both flow
cytometry and immunocytochemistry (APAAP). Surprisingly, the cultured
myoloma cells did not express the GPI-linked complement regulatory proteins
CD55 and CD59 as well as the GPI-anchored cell surface molecules CD48 and
CD58, which were found present on all other established myeloma cell lines
tested (LOPRA-1, U266, ARH-77, RPMI 8226). The GPI-anchored molecules
could not be induced by in vitro treatment of LOPRA-2 cells with various
recombinant cytokines (IFN alpha, IFN gamma, TNF alpha, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL1
to IL8) or differentiation-inducing agents (TPA. retinoids). On the patient's
peripheral rod blood cells and neutrophils no defect for GPI-anchored
proteins could be detected. In addition, the neoplastic plasma cells
freshly isolated from the patient's peripheral blood contained a 10%
subset still expressing CD48, CD55, CD58 and CD59. This suggests that a
somatic mutation occurring in vivo has resulted in a myeloma cell clone
with a defect for GPI-anchored membrane proteins. Cytogenetic analysis
showed shared major chromosomal abnormalities with several abnormal marker
chromosomes between the direct and cell line karyotypes. The LOPRA-2
myeloma cell line may be a suitable tool for further characterizing the
molecular nature of the GPI-anchoring defect.

AB   Yes
TGFalpha is a highly conserved, potent cellular transforming/mitotic
peptide, generally thought to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion via
the EGF receptor (EGFr). TGFalpha is thought to play a major role in a
variety of malignant neoplasms. We have shown that freshly harvested
malignant plasma cells of 26/30 MM patients produce the TGFalpha protein.
Benign plasma cells were consitently TGFalpha negative. We confirmed that
TGFalpha production occurs at the mRNA level in 5/9 MM malignant plasma
cell lines, using a PCR method. We were able to induce TGFalpha mRNA in
all 9 MM cell lines after induction with TPA, an agent known to induce
TGFalpha in a variety of other cell types. Having established that
TGFalpha is produced by malignant plasma cells, we then focused on
determining the role of TGFalpha in the pathogenesis of MM. We observed
that the malignant plasma cells were consistently EGFr negative. Recent
studies have shown that differentiated cells such as eosinophils, neurons,
macrophages and fibroblasts can produce TGFalpha, suggesting that TGFalpha
may have actions other than a direct EGFr-mediated transforming/mitotic
process. Since TGFalpha did not appear to act on the malignant plasma
cells via the EGFr, we considered the possibility that the TGFalpha might
act indirectly invivo on other nearby cells, such as stromal cells or
myeloma progenitor cells. Analysis of stromal cultures harvested from the
bone marrow of 12 MM patients revealed that TGFalpha can induce the
stromal cells to produce increased amounts of IL6, a cytokine known to be
important in the growth and maintenance of MM (P<.05). The prominent
TGFalpha production by malignant plasma cells may thus stimulate stromal
cells, which in turn produce IL6 to cause proliferation/maturation of
myeloma precursor cells. We believe that TGFalpha (and IL6) are part of a
group of several growth factors/cytokines that interact to maintain the
malignant plasma cells of MM.

CDw75 antigens, JK-6 is strongty positive with CD38 and CD39 antibodies.
By flow cytometry they were non-reactive with Ia antibodies and B ceil
reagents CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, and CD24. While INA-6 cells are releasing
kappa light chains only, JK-6 cells produce IgG kappa. Both cell lines
could only be initiated with IL-6 supplemented medium and remained IL-6
responsive throughout continuous culture. INA-6 is strictly dependent on
IL-6. No spontaneously secreted IL-6 was found nor could it be induced by
IL-1beta /TNFalpha stimulation. Molecular analysis with RT-PCR revealed
mRNA for the IL-6 receptor in both lines. No IL-6 mRNA was detectable in
INA-6 cells, while in JK-6 minute amounts were observed. Cytogenetic
analysis of both lines revealed, among other abnormalities, a deletion
(7)(p13). lnterestingly, the 7p deletion affects the location ot the IL-6
gene. ln both cell lines, IL-6 dependent proliferation could be inhibited
by IFNalpha. IFNalpha had growth regulatory effects only on JK-6: while
high concentrations were inhibitory, low IFNalpha amounts were clearly
stimulatory. A wide variety of other cytokines including GM-CSF and IL-11
did not have the capacity to influence proliferation. These plasma cell

AB   Yes
The Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSIIV), or human herpesvirus 8
(HHV-8) is consistently present in primary effusion lymphomas (PEL), a
rare distinctive type of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma usually originating
in the body cavities as an effusion. Involvement of an effusion by
malignant myeloma plasma cells is also distinctly rare, occurring in less
than 1% of cases of multiple myeloma (MM). We have identified two HIV-
negative patients with MM who in addition had a myelomatous effusion. Both
myelomatous effusions contained KSHV genome, as evaluated by Southern and
Northern blot analyses. KSHV was visualized within all the malignant
plasma cells by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA). A tumor sample
from one of these patients, obtained 4 months before the development of
the pleural effusion, had no detectable KSHV by Southern blot analysis,
suggesting that KSHV infection of the myeloma cells in the pleural fluid
was a secondary event related to tumor progression. EBV was not detected
in either case. We have established a cell line from one of these cases.
called ME-1. We also screened 21 existing MM cell lines for the presence of
KSHV, and failed to identify any other KSHV-positive line. ME-1 cells
retain a high episomal copy number of KSHV, and preserve all
characteristics of malignant plasma cells, including morphology,
cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and expression of plasma cell-associated
antigens. KSHV can be induced to replicate in ME-1 cells by treatment with
TPA, and infectious particles can be purified. KSHV has been previously
reported to be present in bone marrow stromal cells of patients with MM.
However, patients with MM do not have serologic reactivity to this virus
as determined employing immunofluorescence assays (IFA) using PEL cell lines
as substrates, or ELISA using virus purified from such cell lines. We
hypothesized that this lack of recognition could be due to the presence
of a different viral strain of KSHV in MM patients, that does not cross-
react serologically with that of PEL. We tested whether ME-1 contained
this putative "MM virus", and therefore contained viral antigens
recognized by sera from other patients with MM. We examined serum obtained
from 59 patients with MM or MGUS for the presence of antibodies to KSHV.
IFA using ME-1 cells showed positivity in only two samples from the same
patient, who had homosexuality as a risk factor for KSHV infection. Sera
from five patients with KS and one patient with PEL recognized both
latent and lytic antigens in ME-1 cells. Therefore, we could not
demonstrate the presence of a different, MM-associated virus in this cell
line. These results represent the first demonstration of KSHV within
malignant myeloma plasma cells, and the development of the first KSHV-
positive myeloma cell line. The presence of KSHV in myclomatous effusions
but not in plasma cells in other forms of multiple myeloma is highly
reminiscent of the presence of KSHV in PEL but not in other types of non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma, and further suggests an association behmen KSHV and
the effusion phenotype.

In contrast to other B-cell neoplasias the immunologic phenotype of
myeloma cells is only poorly defined. Therefore we have performed an
extensive immunephenotypic analysis of 3 human myeloma cell lines
established in vitro in our laboratory (LOPRA-1 (IgA2/kappa), LOPRA-2
(IgG1/lambda), LOPRA-3 (IgG3/kappa)) by flow cytometry (FACS 440) and
immunocytochemical staining (APAP). In addition, 10 bone marrow samples of
multiple myeloma patients were phenotyped by APAP technique. The myeloma
cells were consistently negative for surface immunoglobulin and NLA class
II (NLA-DR/DP, HLA-DQ) antigens. Moreover, HLA class II antigens were not
inducible by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. The myeloma cells did not stain for
most B-cell differentiation antigens (CD10 (CALLA), CD19 (B4), CD20 (B1),
CD21 (B2), CD22 (HD39), CD23 (MHM6), CD37 (BL14), CD39 (G28-8)) except
PCA-1 and CD38 (OKT10). Monoclonal antibodies of the CD24 cluster gave a
heterogeneous staining pattern: Some monoclonal antibodies were
consistently negative, whereas others showed a broad reactivity peak which
may be due to posttranslational modifications of the CD24 molecule
synthesized in myeloma cells. In addition, we have employed hybridoma
technology to produce monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens
restricted to myeloma/plasma cells. Six antibodies detected antigens on
the immunizing myeloma cells; two of them displayed a staining pattern
restricted to late B-cell differentiation stages as analysed on a panel of
normal and neoplastic tissues.

A novel GM-CSF dependent cell line derived from a patient with acute
myelofibrosis and subsequent overt AML M1 FAB has been established.
Cytochemistry of ELF-153 is undifferentiated. Surface markers are: CD33
93%, CD34 99%, CDw41 72%, CD7 46%, CDw42b 7%. Electron microscopy shows a
clear megakaryocytic component with demarkation membranes in mature cells.
Cytogenetics was identical to that of the patient and revealed a monosomy
7, 14 and 17, a deletion (5)(q13q31), and t(12;14) (p11.2;q11.2). The
supernatant of ELF-153 stimulates the growth of NRK-49F fibroblasts in a
cloning assay and the growth of bovine endothelial cells. It stimulates
HEL cells to secrete IL-6. In co-cultivation ELF-153 adheres to
fibroblasts and endothelial cells. After subcutaneous injection into nude
mice a formation of tumors with a rigid texture was observed. Histological
examination demonstrated a dense infiltration by blast cells, and a
pronounced reticular fibrosis consisting exclusively of collagen III. The
cell line ELF 153-GM will facilitate research on the interrelationship of
malignant hemopoiesis and its stroma.

We describe a representative cellular model of MDR resistance developed in
a patient with breast adenocarcinoma. This model consists of two cell
lines CAL 85-1 and CAL 85-2. CAL 85-1 comes from the primary tumor after
first chemotherapy (adriamycin, 5-FU, cyclophosphamide). CAL 85-2 is
obtained 9 months later, following adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU,
epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) and heavy chemotherapy (melphalan) before
auto-grafting of bone marrow, from a chest recurrence. We give the
morphological and cytogenetic characteristics of these two lines. For this
model, MDR expression was measured by cytofluorimetry at using monoclonal
antibodies C 219, JSB 1 and MRK 16. Only the latter shows a difference in
MDR expression in favor of CAL 85-2. The efficacy of 3 MDR reversants,
verapamil, cyclosporine and S 9788 is consistent with a moderate
difference in MDR expression between CAL 85-1 and CAL 85-2. This cellular
system seems closer to reality clinical than those previously established
in vitro by artificial selective pressure.

In recent years, tilapia has become the prime domesticated species in fish
culture in many countries. Due to easy breeding, high productivity and
palatability and strong tolerance of environmental factors, the farming of
tilapia has proved to be a worthy economic enterprise in Taiwan. However,
as culture activity increases, the risk of diseases runs high. In the past
three years there were several outbreaks of diseases of tilapia which
caused high mortality rates (unpublished data) and it was possible that a
virus infection may have been the cause. In order to investigate tilapia
viruses, a cell line derived from homogenous tissues is urgently needed.
The present paper describes the establishment of a cell line from kidney
of healthy tilapia.

In spite of the establishment of modern techniques like PCR for virus
detection, virus isolations in susceptible fish cell lines are still the
basis for international certification of most notifiable viral fish
diseases mentioned by the OIE and the European Union. Cell cultures may
change in susceptibility. If no regular susceptibility checks are done in
the laboratory, using an alternative sensitive cell culture might
therefore increase the chance of isolating a certain virus. The CCB
(common carp brain) cell line, developed by and cultured according to
Neukirch et al., 1999, was originally developed for the diagnosis of koi
herpesvirus (KHV). Moreover, we isolated other viruses from diseased koi
in CCB cells. Besides KHV, myxoviruses, birna-and/or reoviruses (not all
isolates were identified) and rhabdoviruses (spring viraemia of carp
virus, SVCV) were obtained. The susceptibility of CCB cells was also
investigated for viruses isolated from golden ide, European eel and
salmonids. CCB cells and the standard cell lines used in our laboratory:
Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid, EPC, Chinook Salmon Embryo, CHSE and Eel
kidney, EK-1 for the different viruses were inoculated with the following
viruses: infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV, strains Sp, Ab and
Ni), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV, serotype I, II and III),
infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), golden ide reovirus
(GiRV), chum salmon reovirus (CSV), herpesvirus anguillae (HVA), and
another eel virus designated A1B virus. Non-infected cell lines were
incubated as negative controls. Two passages were carried out in the cell
lines before quantification of virus infectivity by titration of
supernatants in 10-fold dilution steps. Table 1 summarizes the inoculated

Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy virus (VERv) represents a major
threat for many wild and farmed fish species among which the European sea
bass is preferentially infected during young life stages. We are currently
investigating the possibilities of immunising young sea bass against VERv
by means of mucosal (immersion) vaccination employing inactivated VERv.
VERv-free sea bass of 2-10 grams were immunised by immersion in virus
solution for various times and then sampled after 24, 48, 72 hours, and
after 30 days. The results of this round of immunisations showed that: i)
no serum antigen-specific IgM can be detected by ELISA; no in vitro VERv-
induced gill leukocyte proliferation can be induced; iii) a modulation in
transcription levels of genes coding for IFN, Mx, ISG-12, IgT was observed
after 24 hours; iv) immunohistochemistry showed the presence of VERv
antigens. These results show that a single immersion vaccination without
boosting does not induce systemic IgM-based immunity in sea bass. A
control experiment where VERv was administered intraperitoneally showed
the presence of serum antigen-specific IgM. The sea bass cell line DLEC
has been transfected with a plasmid encoding VERv capsid protein, and
transfected cells have been used to immunise juveniles intraperitoneally.
After 30 days sera and leukocytes were collected, and results showed that
sera of fish were positive in ELISA against adsorbed VERv and that
leukocytes from spleen and head kidney proliferated in vitro in response
to VERv, suggesting interesting possibilities for this system to be
employed to investigate antiviral immune responses. Finally, by employing
a rabbit antiserum against VERv (pAb 283) and a mouse monoclonal against
VERv capsid protein (mAb 4C3) we have developed a Capture ELISA system to
detect and quantitate the presence of VERv in solutions and biological
fluids. Overall, our results represent a first comprehensive approach to
detect and investigate the effects of VERv immunisation of sea bass.

Cell lines are cultures of animal cells that can be propagated repeatedly
and used as convenient alternatives to whole animals in research. The
aquaculture of Atlantic salmon is an economically important industry that
is looking to soybean meal as a cheap and readily available component for
feeds of the future, but soybean meal has been found to cause gut
inflammation, which restricts growth. Myofibroblasts regulate inflammation
so the availability of a cell line could allow the soybean components
responsible for inflammation to be identified and studied more quickly
than with fish. Towards this goal, we describe herein a cell line, with
characteristics of myofibroblasts, derived from the gut of Atlantic salmon.

Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, are highly valued fish for both fisheries
and aquaculture in Canada and world-wide. Growth and reproduction in this
species have been widely studied and factors regulating their life cycle
including somatic growth, sexual maturation and reproduction, spawning,
smoltification have been extensively investigated. However, the molecular
mechanisms controlling expression of the hormones involved in these
processes are largely unknown. Pituitary cell cultures could be valuable
for elucidating these mechanisms, and cell lines derived from this
teleost's pituitary could make significant impacts in understanding growth
and hormonal regulation as well as endocrine disruption by environmental
contaminants. Here we report on the development of two continuous cell
lines derived from adult Atlantic salmon pituitary and their preliminary

invasive-metastatic activity and chemosensitivity. The TSG11 cell line was
derived from a primary gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma, the patient of
which ran an aggressive clinical course. Another cell line TGBG3 was
derived from a primary gallbladder hepatoid adenocarcinoma, the patient of
which has been free from disease for 10 years. TSG11 cell showed more
intimate similarity to immature hepatocyte in both aspects of cell
morphology and cell function than TGBG3 cells. However, some experiments
concerning invasive-metastatic activity and chemo-sensitivity done in the

had more highly malignant character. Probably the reason why the parent
tumor of TSG11 cells was highly malignant was due to other factors which

A comparative study on the cytotoxic effect of fumonisin B1 (FB1) was
carried out on BALB/c 3T3 and DEC 99 cell lines. The newly tested
cell line DEC 99 appeared as more sensitive than BALB/c 3T3 line according
to the performed Neutral red uptake assay. Light microscopic investigations
of DEC99 cultures treated with FB1 showed altered monolayer with free of
cells spaces and abundance of dead cells. The immunocytochemical techniques
(immunofluorescent and immunogold labelling) proved the influx of the
toxin through the cell membranes. The toxin was visualized in the cytoplasm
and in the nucleus of the treated cells.

A new human retinoblastoma cell line (NCC-RbC-39) was established from a
tumor sample of a 3-year-old boy with a unilateral retinoblastoma. The
components of the medium used to establish the retinoblastoma cell line
were the same as used previously by us to grow colonies of cultured
retinoblastoma cells. This medium was used with 12 consecutive fresh
specimens to test its ability to support the growth of primary
retinoblastoma cells. One specimen (NCC-RbC-39) from the 12 grew in the
medium for more than a year. Several biological characteristics of the
cells of the established NCC-RbC-39 line were compared with those of the
cells from the original tumor. 1) The tumors produced in nude mice
injected with NCC-RbC-39 cells showed a histopathological pattern similar
to that of the original tumor. 2) The cells from both the original tumor
and the established line showed a sensitivity to L-phenylalanine mustard
in a human tumor clonogenic assay but loss of sensitivity to mitomycin C
and adriamycin during the process of establishment. 3) Karyotypes of both
the established cell line and the original tumor were diploid (46,XY)
involving a common +1q chromosomal aberration with the established line
having a few additional aberrations. This cell line appeared to conserve
most of the original biological properties and may be useful for
biological as well as drug sensitivity studies of retinoblastoma.

AB   Yes
In this study the in-vitro susceptibility of murine myeloid precursors
(GM-CFU) and murine leukemia cells (WEHI-3B(D+) and L1210 lines) to
ciprofloxacin (CPX), lomefloxacin (LMX), ofloxacin (OFX), pefloxacin (PFX)
and rufloxacin (RFX) was compared. The two leukemia lines were equally
susceptible and significantly more sensitive than GM-CFU. To develop a
model for studying the mechanism of the inhibitory effect, we established
a WEHI-3B(D+) subclone resistant to CPX (WEHI-3B/CPX). The IC50 of CPX for
the resistant variant was 17.3 times higher than that for the parental
line and the resistance was not reversed by verapamil. Further, the
resistance of the WEHI-3B/CPX variant towards either other quinolones
(IC50 ratios from 1.12 to 1.83) or to other topoisomerase II inhibitors
such as VP-16, VM-26 and adriamycin (IC50 ratios ranging from 0.96 to 1.
22) did not increase significantly. The WEHI-3B/CPX variant expresses CPX
resistance for 60 passages (13 months) in the absence of the selecting
agent, suggesting genetic stability. CPX uptake by the variant clone was
reduced by 50%, however, as observed by Western blotting, P-170
glycoprotein was not expressed. The variant clone and the wild type line
were tested for their proliferative capacity, agar clonogenicity and IL-3
production and no significant differences were noted. These observations
confirm that quinolones act on the proliferation of mammalian cells
producing a dose dependent-inhibition and that leukemia cells show a
greater sensitivity to this inhibitory action in comparison with normal
myeloid cells. Further, since the WEHI-3B/CPX cell line is a genetically
stable CPX-resistant variant with a phenotype which is not cross-resistant
to other quinolones, novobiocin, and antineoplastic drugs active on
topoisomerase II, it represents a new, interesting model for studying the
mechanism of drug resistance of mammalian cells.

Background: The small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an epithelial tumour with
the morphological and secretory characteristics of neuroendocrine cells
(neurone-specific enolase, N-CAM, neuropeptides). The establishment of a
SCLC cell line provides an in vitro model to analyze the neuroendocrine
secretion of these malignant cells.

Methods: Bombesin, delta sleep inducing factor (DSIP) and arginine
vasopressin (AVP) were studied by immunohistochemistry and by in situ
hybridization. NADPH diaphorase activity was detected using an
histochemical technique.

Results: All the cells contained bombesin, DSIP, AVP and displayed a NADPH
diaphorase activity with reflects a nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity.

Conclusions: These data present the characteristics of a new SCLC cell
line (CPN) and show the complexity of its neuroendocrine secretion; for
example, the presence of DSIP and NO synthase activity which have not yet
been demonstrated in other SCLC cell lines.

Fifty-two polyoma-induced primary mouse tumors were tested for
transplantability in isologous recipients. Thirty-five tumors grew
progressively in the subcutaneous tissue, and several lines have been
established in serial transplantation. The remaining tumors did not grow
out at all upon transfer. Eleven among the transplantable tumors have been
tested by inoculating known numbers of cells to the following three groups
of adult isologous recipients: (a) untreated mice, maintained at a
separate, polyoma-free colony, (b) mice preimmunized as adults against
polyoma virus containing supernatant fluids from infected mouse embryo
tissue cultures, and (c) mice pretreated with heavily irradiated cells of
the same tumor. There was a clear and consistent difference between groups
a and b for ten of eleven tumors, indicating a state of resistance against
transplantation of the established polyoma tumors in the virus-immunized
group. With the exception of two out of nine experiments, there was no
evidence of resistance in group c, pretreated with irradiated tumor cells.
Serum of virus-immunized mice had a certain inhibiting effect on viable
polyoma tumor cells upon incubation in vitro with one of four tumors. The
possible implications of these findings have been discussed.

number about the mode. Analysis of the karyotypes revealed that most of
the chromosomes could be grouped superficially into the various groups
described for the normal human karyotype. The heteroploidy of the cells
was due to extrasomy of all groups, with the exception of group G, which

Overexpression of the proto-oncogene c-erbB2 is observed in 30% of breast
tumors and is considered an adverse prognostic factor for breast cancer.
However, the molecular mechanisms associated with c-erbB2 overexpression
are not yet understood. In this work, transcriptional changes associated
with c-erbB2 overexpression were investigated using Massively Parallel
Signature Sequencing (MPSS). MPSS is a powerful technique for genome-wide
gene expression analysis, which relies on the production and
quantification of short tags proximal to the 3' end of transcripts. Over
24 million MPSS tags, representing aproximately 17,000 different genes
were generated for a immortalized mammary luminal epithelial cell line
(HB4a) and for a variant cell line (C5.2) transfected with c-erbB2. After
establishing reliable correlations between tags and known human
transcripts, 9% of the tags could not be associated with a known
transcripts and were designated orphan tags. Among the orphan tags there
were many that showed differential expression between HB4a and C5.2 cell
lines and probably represent novel genes regulated by c-erbB2. In order to
further characterize these novel genes, we have extended 83 tags orphan
tags towards the 3' end of the corresponding mRNA molecule using a
methodology named GLGI (Generation of Longer cDNA fragments for Gene
Identification). Forty one 3' cDNA fragments were obtained and similarity
analysis of these fragments using BLAST allowed the identification of 10
transcripts putativelly regulated by c-erB2. Differential expression in
the C5.2 cell line of 3 out of the 10 transcripts putativelly regulated by
c-erbB2 was confirmed by real-time PCR. We are currently investigating the
effects of Herceptin treatment on gene expression patterns in HER2-
amplified and nonamplified breast cancer cell lines in order to elucidate
the molecular consequences of blocking the HER pathway.

Several studies have indicated that bipotential liver stem cells, also
called oval cells (OC), may give rise to liver cancers. We have endeavored
to establish and characterize a cancer cell line from our model of
combined hepatocholangiocarcinoma (CHCC) in rats. This model is suggestive
of a stem cell origin of the primary liver tumor, since the induction of
OC proliferation followed by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure results in both
hepatocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. F344 rats were subjected to
2-acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) followed by partial hepatectomy (PH) to induce
OC activation. At the point of maximal OC proliferation, animals were
injected with AFB1, and sacrificed at 8 months following carcinogen
exposure. Cancer cells were isolated from the tumor nodules by collagenase
digestion, and cultured in DMEM serum-free media for 72 hours. Cells were
then transferred into DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS. The
established cell line was characterized for growth kinetics, cell
morphology, immunophenotype and karyotype. The primary tumors were well-
differentiated CHCC, intermingled with OC. The cancer cell line, LCSC-1,
was sub-cloned 3 weeks after establishment of the primary culture and has
been maintained through multiple passages. In culture these cells adopted
a cobble stone appearance, being compact, polygonal-shaped with an
epithelioid morphology. These cells demonstrated a complete loss of
contact inhibition and were able to grow in multiple layers after reaching
confluence. Doubling time at passage 4 was 18 hours. Immunostaining
demonstrated that LCSC-1 expressed the OC marker OV-6, which was also
expressed by the primary tumor cells. Additionally, RT-PCR showed that
LCSC-1 expressed mRNA for both albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. Cytogenetic
analysis at passage 4 revealed an aneuploid karyotype with a modal
chromosome number of 41 and evidence of chromosomal abnormalities. We
believe that LCSC-1 represents a cancer stem cell line. Transplantation
studies to assess the tumorigenicity of these cells are currently underway.

Recent studies have established that a high proportion of prostate cancer
harbors a gene fusion between the androgen regulated TMPRSS2 gene and the
ETS genes ERG, ETV1 or ETV4. However in vitro model representing primary
tumors to study the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of
this important chromosomal rearrangement are currently limited and are
greatly needed. The tumor tissue (RC-123T) used for generating the
RC-123T/E cell line with HPV-16 E6E7 genes was obtained from a 57 year old
familial prostate cancer patient who had adenocarcinoma with well
differentiation (Gleason 3+3). The cell line was characterized
phenotypically and cytogenically. Dual color fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) assay was used to test for ERG (3'5') break aparts,
and for translocation of TMPRSS2 and ERG and ETV1, in both interphase
nuclei as well as metaphases. The cells were also characterized for
putative stem cell markers CD133, SOX2 and prostate cell markers by
immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. We have successfully established an
immortalized human prostate epithelial cell culture derived from primary
tumors of familial prostate cancer patients carrying TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
genes with HPV16 E6E7 genes (RC-123T/E). RC-123T/E cells are currently
growing well at passage 30, whereas RC-123T cells senesced at passage 5.
Expression of an androgen-regulated prostate specific homeobox gene, NKX3.
1, the epithelial cell-specific cytokeratin 8 and androgen receptor but
not prostate specific antigen, was detected in RC-123T/E cells. TMPRSS2-
ERG genes were also expressed in this line. The RC-123T/E cells formed
spheres under suspension culture and branched differentiated in matrigel.
The RC-123T/E cells also expressed putative stem cell markers CD133 and
SOX2. Interestingly, the FISH analysis showed the translocation of
chromosome t(7;21)(q21:q21) in the RC-123T/E cell line and also in its
primary tumor tissue. We demonstrate that RC-123T/E cell line and its
primary tumor tissue possess the translocation of TMPRSS2/ERG to
chromosome 7q which adds another class of gene arrangement in prostate
cancer. In addition, this cell line expressed putative stem cell markers
and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. This model provides a novel tool to study the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of TMPRSS2-ETS genes in prostate cancer.

Malignant rhabdoid tumors of kidney (MRT)) and brain (atypical teratoid

typically have a poor prognosis, manifest a high level of de novo
multidrug resistance. We have established 3 new AT/RT and MRT cell lines:
CHLA-266 (AT/RT, with supratentorial metastasis at diagnosis), COG-AR-359
(brain AT/RT at diagnosis), and COG-AR-382 (abdominal malignant rhabdoid
tumor at diagnosis from the same patient as COG-AR-359). All 3 cell lines
lack expression of the INI1 tumor suppressor gene and have INI1 gene
mutations in chromosome band 22q11.2. Cell line identity to the patient
was verified by short tandem repeat assay. CHLA-266 and COG-AR-382 grow
as adherent cultures with doubling times of 40hrs and 82hrs,
respectively, whereas COG-AR-359 has a mixed adherent/suspension
phenotype with a doubling time of 53hrs. CHLA-266 and COG-AR-359 were
tumorgenic in NOD/SCID mice, but COG-AR-382 was not tumorgenic to date.
Drug cytotoxicity for etoposide (ETOP), cyclophosphamide (4-HC),
temozolomide (TMZ), thiotepa, topotecan (TPT), and fenretinide (4-HPR)
employed fluorescein diacetate and digital image microcopy (DIMSCAN). All
3 new lines showed multi-drug resistance, with the concentration lethal
for 90% of cells (LC90) well above clinically achievable plasMA levels
for all drugs tested except for 4-HPR. However, 4-HPR as a single agent
had only modest activity. Interestingly, we observed synergistic
cytotoxicity when 4-HPR was combined with thiotepa (Combination index at
LC90 = 0.60 for COG-AR-359 and 0.1 for CHLA-266). Thiotepa as a single
agent achieved a mean of 1.45 logs kill activity, 4-HPR < 1 log, but
thiotepa + 4-HPR produced a mean of 3.4 logs of cell kill. Thus, we have
used newly established AT/RT cell lines that are resistant to commonly-
used cytotoxic drugs to identify a synergistic combination of drugs with
activity against AT/RT cell lines.

OvBH-1 cells from a patient with ovarian clear cell carcinoma were
established and their biochemical status was analysed. Cells grown at 37
Celsius exhibited normal cell cycle distribution, whereas the cells
shifted to 31 Celsius were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.
Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-p53 antibodies (DO-1, PAb240,
PAb421, and PAb1620) revealed that only the DO-1 antibody reacted with p53
to a high and similar level (percentage) at both temperatures. PAb240
reacted to a low level (percentage) at 37 Celsius, and no reaction was
observed at 31 Celsius. The PAb421 antibody stained a significantly lower
percentage of cells at 37 Celsius than at 31 Celsius. The cells did not
stain with the PAb1620 antibody, and were negative for antibodies against
the p21WAF1 and MDM2 proteins independently of temperature. The sequencing
of all the coding exons of the p53 gene demonstrated only a neutral
genetic polymorphism, i.e. a G to A substitution (GAG to GAA) at
nucleotide position 13432. Thus, the observed temperature sensitivity of
OvBH-1 cells cannot be ascribed to a p53 primary structure mutation. Based
on immunochemical analyses, we conclude that the p53 in the nuclei of OvBH-1
cells appears to be in a highly unstable conformation. Furthermore, the
N-terminal portion of the p53 protein at Ser20 has not been modified, and

This paper describes the preparation of a mouse monoclonal antibody JS-1
directed against human fibronectin. This is a fusion product of mouse
myeloma X63Ag8.653 and of spleen cells from a BALB/c mice which had been
immunized with fibronectin isolated from human serum. This antigen was
visualized as two bands (MW 200-250 kD) in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. ELISA
and immunohistology have shown that the produced antibodies react with
structures containing fibronectin and extracellular protein and belonged
to the IgM class of immunoglobulin. Flow cytometric analysis of the
hybridoma cells had tetraploid DNA content and a high percentage of cells
in the S-phase fraction of the cell cycle.

Thrombin produced upon tissue damage provides a link between
inflammation/blood coagulation and immune reactions through proteinase-
activated receptor (PAR) types 1, 3 and 4. In contrast to PAR1 and PAR4,
functions of PAR3 in cells other than platelets are poorly understood. We
generated mAb 8E8 against fragment 31-47, which includes the thrombin
cleavage site of human PAR3. MAb 8E8 bound mouse platelets and delayed
their aggregation induced by thrombin. This antibody also specifically
stained B-lymphocyte-derived hybridoma in flow cytometry. Thrombin dose-
dependently inhibited hybridoma cell proliferation and so did mAb 8E8 and
PAR3 31-47 fragment, but not the PAR4 activating peptide. It is concluded
that mAb 8E8 recognizes PAR3 expressed in hybridoma and mimics the
inhibitory effect of thrombin on hybridoma proliferation mediated by PAR3.
The data obtained also suggest that, unlike in platelets, targeting PAR3
in mouse B lymphocyte-derived cells doesn't involve PAR4.

AB   Yes
GPR120 (also called FFAR4) is a member of the rhodopsin family of G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is expressed in type II taste bud
cells. It is implicated in the ability to taste free fatty acids, as its
absence leads to reduced preference in mice to the free fatty acids oleic
acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2), as well as decreased neuronal
response to oral free fatty acids. The domestic cat (Felis catus) is an
obligate carnivore and so naturally eats a meat-based diet, i.e.
consisting mainly of protein and fat. Hence, we hypothesised that the cat
has evolved to recognise and metabolise compounds from meat sources,
including free fatty acids. However, the taste perception of free fatty
acids for cats has not been studied in detail. Here we developed the first
recombinant cell line expressing cat GPR120. We derived a consensus
sequence for the short isoform, synthesized its full-length coding
sequence and expressed it in a stable CHO cell line. The in vitro assay
was optimised for High Throughput Screening (HTS) and used to screen 121
compounds, including a range of free fatty acids and related compounds. 34
were identified as agonists, of which 24 had EC50 values <10 muM. None of
the compounds showed any specific activity as a Positive Allosteric
Modulator (PAM). Several long-chain free fatty acids were found to be
agonists for the cat GPR120 receptor, including oleic acid and linoleic
acid. The results of the behavioural tests are presented by Marshall et al.
These results bring a new perspective on the taste and dietary preferences
of the domestic cat.

Methods: HuLEC were isolated independently (GWD and ECL), then
immortalized as previously described (Ades, et al. J. Invest. Dermatol.
99:683-90, 1992) The cell lines, CDC.EU./HuLEC-1 and 2, were characterized
for endogenous expression of various molecules using flow cytometry.

Results: Both cell lines constitutively expressed HLA class I but not
class II alloantigens. Features characteristic of endothelial cells, i.e.
staining for low density lipoprotein and von Willebrand's factor were
present in both cell lines.

Conclusions: HuLEC have been isolated and immortalized, providing tools
for further study of the mechanisms underlying acute allograft rejection
following lung transplantation.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading with main cause of death is
liver and lung metastasis. Using of a combination of genetic and
epigenetic markers are addressed but the results have not been approved in
clinical practice. A set of serum biomarkers has been proposed to increase
accuracy in early diagnosis of CRC. In addition, non-invasive as well as
the best prognostic panel of biomarkers and define predictive biomarkers
for treatment of CRC are all aims of future research. HSPGs is an
important biomolecule involving in cancer cell proliferation,
differentiation, and migration. Membrane HSPGs shed into blood circulation
and matrix in particular circumstance can be used as a specific biomarker
for some cancer cells. In order to evaluate the benefit of a panel of anti-
HSPGs monoclonal antibodies in increasing specificity to detect CRC, four
clones of anti-HSPGs were studied for its specific reaction on various
tumor cell lines by indirect immunofluorescent technique and analyzed by
flow cytometer compared to normal white blood cells. A combination of two
or more clones were focused. The results showed that all four clones
presented a variation in reaction to all solid tumor cell lines tested but
negative to normal white blood cells from different ABO blood groups.
Interestingly, amongst those cells tested, HT29, a colorectal cancer cell
lines were significantly reacted with all four monoclonal antibodies.
Taken together, we proposed a panel of four anti-HSPGs monoclonal

AB   Yes
Objective: To investigate the mechanism of resistance and reversal effect
of ligustrazine and cyclosporin A in cisplatin-induced multidrug
resistance ovarian cancer cell line 3Ao/cDDP.

Methods: Using the corresponding dose calculated from clinical
chemotherapy at 30 mg cisplatin per cycle, we established 3Ao/cDDP with
3Ao exposed at regular intervals and repeatedly to high-level
concentration of cisplatin at 10 mug/ml for 24 hours each time.
Expressions of LRP, MRP, P-gp, GSTp and TopoII were quantitatively
detected with FCM. For drug resistance reversal, cyclosporin A and
ligustrazine were administered singly or in combination at the maximal
dose without cytotoxicity. Inhibition rates were determined by MTT assay.

Results: 3Ao/cDDP was established after 4.5 months, with resistance factor
1.6 which was similar to clinical resistance degree. Low expression levels
of MRP and P-gp were found in both 3Ao and 3Ao/cDDP (P>0.05), and LRP and
GSTx expression levels in 3Ao/cDDP were significantly higher than those in
3Ao (P<0.005 and P<0.05, respectively), and TopoII in 3Ao/cDDP was
significantly lower vs 3Ao (P<0.05). The inhibition rate of cDDP was 20.
807 +- 0.015%, cDDP plus iigustrazine 27.421 +- 0.07% (P>0.05 vs cDDP), cDDP
plus cyclosporin A 49.635 +- 0.021% (P<0.01 vs cDDP), and cDDP plus
ligustrazine and cyclosporin A 58.861 +- 0.014% (P<0.01 vs cDDP).

Conclusions: 3Ao/cDDP, induced by cisplatin and established by imitating
the characteristics of clinical chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian
cancer, was an ideal model for investigation of cisplatin resistance in
vitro. Cisplatin resistance in 3Ao/cDDP could be accounted for by higher
LRP, GSTp and lower TopolI expression and was not associated with MRP or
P-gp. Ligustrazine had no significant reversal effect on cisplatin
resistance, but cyclosporin A could reverse the resistance effectively.

Permanent cell lines TJ8510 and TJ861 derived from the original and

lines. As compared to the characteristics of original cell line (TJ8510),
it was found that the surface structures of the recurrent cell (TJ861)
were more complicated and had much more microvilli and globoid processes
on surfaces in ultrastructural examination and showed a higher S phase
fraction and colony forming efficiency. Most of the cells had a marker
chromosome 11/1q and their model chromosome number was hypertriploid. The
cells were resistant to BCNU as high as 50mug/ml. It is suggested that the
stem cells of the recurrent malignant astrocytoma might grow from those
original malignant tumor cells which were more proliferative, highly
aggressive and had stronger resistance to BCNU.

Aim: To establish a arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-resistant leukemic cell line
to explore the mechanism of resistance to As2O3, and the relationship
between the resistant cell line and the multidrug resistance was also
investigated.

Methods: The arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-resistant leukemic cell line was
established by exposing the cells to the increasing concentration of As2O3.
MTT assay was used to detect the cytotoxicity. Cell cycle was detected by
PI assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect the P-glycoprotein on the
surface of the cells, the intracellular concentration of DNR, and the
immune type of the cells.

Results: The cell doublings time and the cell cycle of the arsenic
trioxide (As2O3)-resistant leukemic cell line, K562/AS2, is similar to
that of K562. The relative resistant fold of K562/AS2 to As2O3, DNR, VP16
and Ara-C was 7.4, 2.9, 3.8 and 1.1, respectively. The relative resistant
fold of multidrug resistant cell line, K562/AS2, to As2O3, DNR, VP16 and
Ara-C was 0.8, 9.4, 2.5 and 0.9, respectively. The fluorescence of the
P-glycoprotein on the surface or of the DNR inside the cells detected was
not significantly different between the K562 and the K562/AS2 cell lines.

Conclusions: A cell line, K562/AS2, resistant to clinical achieving level
(2 mumol/L) of As2O3 has been established. The relative resistant fold of
K562/ AS2 to As2O3 is about 7.4 fold to the parent K562 line sensitive to
As2O3. Partial resistance of K562/AS2 to DNR and VP16 is observed , the
mechanism of which is unrelated to the P-gp, the expression product of

Aim: To study the mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) of leukemia
cells induced by homoharringtonine (HHT) and the reversal effect of
mifepristone on MDR.

Methods: Human leukemia cell line K562 was induced into MDR cell line by
intermittent administration of high dose of HHT. MTT assay was used to
detect the sensitivity of these MDR cells to all sorts of chemotherapeutic
agents with or without mifepristone. The cytotoxicity of mifepristone was
also observed. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of MDR1 gene and
glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) gene. Flow cytometry was used to detect
the expression of P-glucoprotein and the accumulative value of
intracellular daunorubicin (DNR) in these MDR cells with or without
mifepristone. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of
Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 in these MDR cells with or without mifepristone.

Results: MDR cell line K562/HHT was acquired after induced by HHT for 2
months. This MDR cell line possessed the ability of 462.6 fold resistance
to HHT and cross-resistance to adriamycin, vincristine and etoposide. The
expression of MDR1 gene, GCS gene, P-glucoprotein and Bcl-2/Bax ratio in
K562/HHT cells were significantly higher than those in K562 cells (P<0.05).
The caspase-3 expression and the accumulative value of intracellular DNR
in K562/HHT cells were significantly lower than those in K562 cells (P<0.05).
10 mum/L mifepristone reversed the resistance of K562/HHT cells to
HHT, adriamycin, vincristine and etoposide at different levels. The
Bcl-2/Bax ratio, caspase-3 expression and accumulative value of intracellular
DNR in K562/HHT cells treated with RU486 were significantly different
compared with K562/HHT cells without RU486 treatment (P<0.05).

Conclusions: Leukemia cell line K562 can be induced into MDR cell line
K562/HHT by HHT. P-glucoprotein, GCS, Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caspase-3 may
play an important role in K562/HHT cells. Mifepristone can reverse MDR in
K562/HHT cells by decreasing the accumulative value of intracellular drug
and regulating the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3.

Hematogenous metastasis to the lungs is a major complication in patients
with different types of sarcomas. Investigations of the mechanisms of
tumor spread and the search for new treatment modalities have been
hindered by the lack of appropriate in vivo model systems. We have now
established such a model involving the experimental metastasis of human
osteosarcoma (HOS) cells in immunodeficient nude mice. Malignant subdones
were isolated from HOS cells transformed by either the viral Ki-ras or a
mutated cellular Ha-ras oncogene. The ras transformants, unlike most other
human malignancies, were capable of forming pulmonary metastases following
intravenous transplantation into mice, an assay that mimics the later
events of blood-borne metastasis. One of the v-Ki-ras-transformed cell
lines, designated KRIB, formed lung tumors in 80%-100% of recipient mice
with a median number of 20 nodules per animal. The tumors, composed of
poorly differentiated human sarcoma cells, were easily detected as
macroscopic nodules within 5 weeks post inoculation. Detection and
isolation of metastatic cells from cultured lung tissue was improved by
the use of selectable geneticin-resistant KRIB cells, obtained by
transfection with pSV2neo DNA. The ability to test the metastatic
potential of human KRIB sarcoma cells in mice makes this model valuable
for both basic and applied research on factors affecting tumor
dissemination to the lungs.

CEM/R1 cells, using 32P, nick-translated human DHFR cDNA probe,
demonstrated amplification of DHFR genes in the CEM/R1 line. Cytogenetic
analysis showed that CEM/R1 cells contained an elongated marker chromosome
having a homogeneous staining region not present in the sensitive cells.
The inhibitory effect of two new folate antagonists was evaluated in
these resistant sublines, as well as in CEM/R4, a HTX resistant subline
(obtained from H. Lazarus) characterized by impaired HTX transport but
normal levels of DHFR. The drugs studied were trimetrezate (JB-11, TMQ,
2,4-diamino-S-methyl-6[(3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)methyl]quinazoline) and
triazinate (TZT, Baker's anti-fol), now in clinical trial.

Permanent cell lines are important tools for studying the biology of human
leukemia. Only 5 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines carrying the
Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome have been established. We report the
establishment of RWLeu-4, a Ph1-positive cell line derived from the
peripheral blood of a patient in the blastic phase of CML. The RWLeu-4
cell is an undifferentiated blast with a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio,
basophillic cytoplasm and two or more nucleoli. The doubling time is 33
hrs. The cloning efficiency is 39%. Peroxidase and esterase stains are
positive. On electron microscopy, irregularly shaped nuclei, distinct
nucleoli and prominent cytoplasmic granules are observed. Karyotypic
analysis demonstrates a modal chromosome number of 56. The Ph1 chromosome
(22 q-) is present. Other rearrangements include 7p+, 12p+ and 17p+. RWLeu-4
cells are negative for Epstein-Barr virus as determined by DNA dot
hybridization Neither IgG nor IgM is detected on the cell surface. Five
percent of the cells are Ia antigen positive and 100% are beta-2
microglobulin positive. Both dimethyl sulfoxide and N-methylformamide
induce myeloid maturation as determined by morphological changes and NBT
dye reduction. In the presence of TPA, the cells become adherent, are
strongly nonspecific esterase positive, and differentiate into macrophage-
appearing cells. RWLeu-4, a Ph1-positive CML cell line with myeloid
characteristics, should prove useful in studying the biology and
differentiation of CML.

DR   Cellosaurus; CVCL_WV44; ARR
AB   Yes
Most acute leukemias can be assigned to a specific stage of either
lymphoid or hematopoietic differentiation. However. in approximately 20%
of pediatric T-ALL there is expression of one or both of tho myeloid-
associated antigens CD13 and CD33. Conversely, in approximately 20% of
pediatric ANLL there is expression of the T lymphoid associated antigen
CD7. In order to further characterize the phenotype and genotype of mixed
lineage leukemia cells, we have established a cell line, ARR, from a CD7+,
surface CD3-(sCD3-), CD33+ T-ALL. Like the original leukemia, the ARR cell
line expressed CD7 and CD33. but not sCD3. The ARR cell line contained a
rearranged TCRbeta gene. Analysis of the mRNA phenotype using reverse
transcription PCR revealed that the ARR cell line expressed GM-CSF
receptor (GM-CSFR) alpha and beta chains, IL7 receptor, and CD3delta. Phorbol
myristate acetate (PHA) treatment induced mRNA for IL6 receptor and the
myelomonocytic antigen CD13. This mRNA phenotype after PMA stimulation was
identical to the mRNA phenotype of 3 cases of myeloid antigen (CD13, CD33)
positive T-ALL and 2 cases of T lymphoid antigen (CD7) positive ANLL. The
phenotype however was different from 1 case of T-ALL not expressing
myeloid features (My- T-ALL) and a My- T-ALL cell line (CEM). The ARR cell
line is a model of a closely related group of acute leukemias which
express transcripts for both myeloid and lymphoid growth factor receptors
and the T lymphoid specific CD3delta. This subgroup differs from My- T-ALL
and may have as its origin a leukemic progenitor cell which possesses a
unique phenotype and genotype.

MSL-G2 cells have previously been described as a highly heterogenous clone
with multiple hormone/neurotransmitter expression. MSL-G2 cells
preferentially express glucagon, cholecystokinin (CCK), and islet amyloid
polypeptide (IAPP), but display small populations of CGRP, insulin, and
somatostatin positive cells. Also the neurotransmitters serotonin and GABA
are expressed in the majority of MSL-G2 cells. MSL-G2 is known to change
its phenotypical composition when passaged in vivo and stable insulinomas
as well as glucagonomas has been established. We now report the
establishment of a highly stable somatostatinoma culture (MSL-G2-Tu6)
which has been maintained in continous culture for more than a year.
Almost 100% of the cells express high levels of immunoreactive
somatostatin. Few insulin, glucagon, CCK, and IAPP cells are still present.
Interestingly, a significant fraction of the cells expressed (3-endorphin
immunoreativity, implicating activation of the POMC gene. The derivation
of the somatostatinoma cell line MSL-G2-Tu6 further support the stemcell
nature of MSL cells. MSL-G2-Tu6 cells constitutes an ideal cell line in

Nine different cell lines from human exocrine pancreatic cancer were
established in tissue culture. Five of these derived from human cancer
tissue transplanted on NMRI nu nu mice. 4 were established from primary
tumors or metastatic lymph nodes recovered during surgery. The tumor
tissue was minced and trvpsinised to obtain a single cell suspension. The
cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Each cell line
showed an individual morphological pattern of growth which remained
constant throughout all passages. The cells generally showed good
adherance to plastic with a variable portion of cells growing in
suspension. These 'floaters' seem to he characteristic for pancreatic
cancer grown in tissue culture. We found very good correlation between the
histological grade of the primary tumor and growth kinetics of the
respective cell line in vitro. Lines derived from low grade tumors were
slow-growing with long replication times in culture as well as in the nude
mouse. Cell lines from grade III tumors on the other hand would divide
rapidly in vitro with a very high percentage of nonadherent floaters,
showing a multicolony pattern of growth. After an average of 5 passages in
vitro. the lines were passed back into nude mice. where they promptly
produced tumors of histomorphology identical to that of the primary
carcinoma. Cytological studies as well as electron microscopy proved the
cultured cells to be morphologically identical to those from the primary
tumor. We established a clonogenic semisolid agar assay for chemotherapy
studies. The cell lines have so far not shown pronounced sensitivity to
any of the comercially available drugs. With the establishment of
continuous in vitro lines from human pancreatic carcinoma. we have a
powerful tool to study the biology of this so far uncurable tumor. They
are of great value for in vitro sensitivity testing with cytostatic

Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against a newly established cell line (HLC-2)
derived from a human large-cell lung carcinoma were prepared by
hybridization between the murine myeloma P3U1 and spleens from immune
BALB/c mice. The specificity of the MoAbs was screened with the panels of
non-neoplastic or neoplastic cultured cells and the tissues of the same
cancer patient as immunogen donor by using antibody-dilution curves and
histological preparations of avidin-biotin-conjugated-peroxidase antibody
technique. Several MoAbs reacted against immunogen cultured cells (HLC-2)
and autologous tumor tissues. Among those MoAbs, two MoAbs (1A7 and 6B3)
reacted at very low or undetectable levels with non-neoplastic cells
(primary-cultured lung epithelial cells and the autologous lung tissues).
In the lung carcinomas, MoAb 1A7 did not react against QG-90 cells (small-
cell carcinoma), PC-13 (large-cell carcinoma) and SK-MES-1 cells (squamous
cell carcinoma), but reacted against Luci 10 cells (adenocarcinoma). And
MoAb 6B3 reacted only against SK-MES-1 cells and HLC-2 cells. Both MoAbs
did not react against other types of tumor cell line (HeLa, uterus
carcinoma and HuL-1, hepatoma). That is, the epitope recognized by MoAb
1A7 exists possibly associating with adenocarcinoma and normal glandular
epithelium of the lung. That of MoAb 6B3 is suggested to associate with
squamous-cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma and to be specific in
neoplastic cells of the lung. The monoclonal antibody-dependent macrophage-
mediated cytotoxicity assay was performed. The inhibition activities of
MoAbs to the target cell growth were found to be enhanced by mixed
cultures with macrophages. And MoAbs 1A7 and 6B3 showed a strong inhibitory
effect. All these findings suggest the potential of the identification of
the molecules of lung cancer-associated antigens and the application on

The primary cells died at passage 67 after 13 mo. in vitro, while KIZ-81A
cells, which had been frozen since passage 3 and kept in liquid nitrogen
for 132 days before thawing, attained only 64 passages. Growth rates of
KIZ-81A cells were determined at passage 7, 11, 30. Comparison was made at
generation 11 of primary cells and cells once frozen. After a lag phase,
all cultures entered the logarithmic growth phase and then the stationary
phase again. The range of cell cycle time, determined by
BUdR[bromodeoxyuridine]-Giemsa method for detection of sister chromatid
exchanges, was from 24-36 h. Karyotype analysis revealed the chromosome
number and construction in KIZ-81A cells (without being frozen and stored)
were more stable than those of the cells once frozen in liquid nitrogen.
In the former, the obvious increase of chromosome number and changes in
construction started from the 51st generation and in the latter from the

The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of a large heterogeneous
population of cells. This complexity makes it difficult to dissect
neuronal functions at a cellular level. One way to resolve this problem is
to use cell lines consisting of homogenous cells originated from the
nervous system. To this end, we have succeeded in establishing cell lines
from the CNS of Drosophila 3rd instar larva: 8 continuous cell lines,
designated as ML-DmBG1~8, and clonal lines from 3 of them (Table 1; Ui et
al., 1994a). Here, we introduce these cell lines and some of the practical
applications.

During early embryogenesis, the olfactory axons and gonadotrophin-
releasing hormone (GnRH)-secreting neurons undergo dynamic processes of
differentiation, migration and proliferation, regulated by a complex
network of molecular and cellular mechanisms responding to various
hormonal and developmental signals. Mutations in anosmin-1 and FGFR1
disrupt this pathway, causing Kallmann's syndrome (KS), a human hereditary
disorder with GnRH deficiency and inability to smell. A primary neuroblast
culture FNCB4, originated from human foetal olfactory epithelium, provided
a useful model to study normal olfactory-GnRH neurogenesis and the
molecular pathogenesis of KS. We have previously shown that anosmin-1
induces neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal rearrangements in FNCB4 cells
through FGFR1 signalling pathway. However, the limited life span of the
primary culture has hindered more versatile application of this unique
cell system. Although a few cell lines have been generated from mouse
neuronal tumours and hypothalamic neurons, none of them truly represents
differentiated human GnRH neurons. The major barrier for immortalisation
of human cells is telomere-dependent senescence. By using ecotrophic
retroviral vector expressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase
(hTERT), we have established an immortal FNCB4 derivative. The cells were
first infected with amphotrophic retrovirus delivering ecotrophic receptor
and neomycin resistance marker. The G418 selected cells were then infected
with pBabe-puro ecotrophic retrovirus containing hTERT. For both
infections, BOSC packaging cell line was used to provide the essential
retroviral proteins in trans. FNCB4-hTERT cells have been continuously
growing far beyond their normal life span with a much shorter doubling
time, while the empty vector infected cells entered senescence. Expression
of specific neuronal markers, receptors and neuropeptides, cellular
morphology and responsiveness to GnRH and calcium transient inducer
metastin will be examined to see if FNCB4-hTERT retains the GnRH olfactory
neuronal characteristics. It will also be analysed for any tumorigenic
changes such as chromosomal abnormalities and mutated tumour
suppressors/oncogenes.

AB   Yes
Culture systems have been of considerable value in examining the metabolic
effects of hormones on bone cells. However, even well-characterized
culture systems have heretofore been heterogeneous in terms of bone cell
types. In the current studies, we report further characterization of a
recently established, stable cell line isolated from mouse bone,
designated MMB-1. This cell line was established by cloning of spontaneous
transformants from primary osteoblast cultures, and was selected for its
ability to increase intracellular cAMP concentrations in response to PTH.
We have now shown that the cAMP response of the cells is similar to that
of primary osteoblasts in magnitude (10-15 fold elevation at maximal doses
of PTH); dose dependency (minimal PTH dose 3 ng per ml, maximal dose 300
ng per ml); and time course (peak elevation 5 min, return to baseline by
30 min). The MMB-1 cells also showed cAMP elevations in response to
osteoclast activating factor (OAF), epinephrine and prostaglandins, but
not to calcitonin, insulin or vitamin D metabolites. In each case where an
agent caused elevated cAMP, there was an associated increase in the
activity of cytoplasmic cAMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that
this enzyme may mediate the cAMP dependent effects of these hormones. In
addition to effects on cAMP, we studied other horm-one modulated
activities of MMB-1 cells: collagen synthesis was inhibited by PTH and OAF
but was stimulated by insulin; alkaline phosphatase activity was decreased
by PTH and OAF; and other synthetic activities associated with osteoblast
function were inhibited by the same agents. None of the hormone effects
seen in MMB-1 cells were detected in primary or several established lines
of fibroblasts or other cells. These data suggest that the MMB-1 cell line
retains a substantial fraction of the differentiated characteristics of
osteoblasts, and that the hormone control of these activities is
essentially identical to that in the normal osteoblast. The availability
of such a monoclonal, stable osteoblast cell line should materially aid
future studies of the regulation of bone cell function by hormones.

like oxygen consumption we established a permanent cell line which
preserved the main morphological properties of the primary cells. Such a
line was derived from dispase-treated hearts of stage 53 tadpoles. After
15 generations a stationary phase was reached. From cells which overcame
this phase several sublines have been established. Their altered growth
behaviour and chromosomal variations ascertain the transformed status of
the XTH cells.

long maintenance in liquid nitrogen. The 97-th passage showed 2 peaks of
modal class chromosomes 36 and 38 in 64-56% of the cells respectively.
Proliferation indey is 4.45-5.14. 24 hours after infection of the culture
by production "K" strain of the European Swine Fever Pestivirus we could
observe gemmation of the cytoplasm in the form of a "crown" as well as
nuclei pyknosis, condensation of chromatin blocks near the nucleus
membrane and nucleolus hypertrophy. Later, on the 4-th day degenerative
changes in the monolayer were observed. 8 hours after infection by the
virus of pig encephalomyocarditis degeneration of cells starts,
cytoplasmatic inclusions appear and cytoplasm vacuolization, nuclei
pyknosis and pathological mitosis take place. Monolayer is completely
destroyed in 17 hours. After infection of the culture by equine herpes
virus (1st type of the strain SV/69) the cells became rounded, multinuclei
symplasts were formed, nuclei deformed and pyknotied and intranuclear
infusion could be observed. On the 3rd day all the cells perish. The hybrid

We isolated lung epithelial cells from an adult male Wistar rat by pronase
digestion and cultured them in Ham's F12 medium containing 5% FBS,
insulin, transferrin, EGF, aFGF and cholera toxin. Out of a mixed cell
population containing type II pneumocytes and ciliated cells as the major
cell types, one cell type was established as a spontaneously immortalized
cell line, This adherent cell line expresses different cytokeratins (CK)
as intermediate filaments, which is specific for epithelial cells. The
predominant appearance of CK 14 and 15, determined by western blotting at
passage 42, points to a possibly bronchial basal cell origin. During
ageing the postconfluent monolayers produce a squamous cell layer that
reacts with a desmoplakin antibody, which recognizes desmosomal structures
that are typical for epithelial cells. In addition, markers for type II
cells, Clara cells and fibroblasts are lacking. The cell line was passaged
more than 40 times within 9 months with population doubling times that
decreased from 31 h to 19 h with increasing passage number. These rat
bronchial epithelial cells (RaBE) are able to grow at cloning density on a
plastic surface with a CFE of 36 +- 3.6% (mean&SD, n=10, 200 cells/100 mm
dish), Chromosome analysis revealed a shift from 62 to 75 chromosomes
(median, n=20-50) between passage 9 and 19. Although immortalized, the
cell line did not change to a transformed phenotype, as indicated by the
strong dependency on serum and growth factors. Whether these cells
represent pluripotent stem cells that are able to differentiate under
complex culture conditions is part of our current investigation. This rat
bronchial epithelial (RaBE) cell line is now well established and might be
useful for cell communication or toxicity tests, and possibly for mutation

Abnormality in HLA-class I antigen expression in primary and metastatic
melanoma lesions, evidenced by immunohistochemical staining with mAbs, are
reported in several studies. Defects range from total HLA class I antigen
loss to selective loss of one of the HLA class I specificities (Ferrone S.,
Immunology today, 1995; 16: 487). Since HLA antigens are the restricting
elements presenting several melanoma associated antigens-derived peptides
to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, the down-regulation of HLA class I antigen
expression can represent a mechanism of tumor escape from immune
surveillance (Seliger B., Immunology today, 2000; 21: 455). To investigate
the involvement of membrane associated antigens in functional recognition
of melanoma cells by immune effectors, we stabilised in vitro 25 human
melanoma cell lines starting from surgical removed primary and/or
metastatic tumors. All the lines showed, by cytofluorimetric analysis,
significant expression of HMW-MAA, a melanoma associated antigen.
Moreover, HLA Class-I and Class-II expression revealed complete HLA class-I
loss only in two cell lines, ANAD-63 and COPA-159, whereas aberrant
Class-II expression was observed in 5/25 melanoma cell lines. Our
attention is now focused on the lines that seem to have aberrant
expression of HLA antigens trying to understand, by molecular techniques,
the mechanism of possible loss of HLA antigens expression (Wang BZ, J Exp
Med, 1999;190: 205). The HLA class 1 negative melanoma cell line ANAD-63
shows, indeed, a deletion, in frame, of 24 bp in the exon 2 of the beta2-
microglobuline gene, by sequence analysis (codon 59-66). The detected
mutation does not affect synthesis of either m-RNA, revealed by RT-PCR, or
protein, detected by intracellular cytofluorimetric analysis. In
conclusion, loss of HLA class I expression in ANAD-63 appears to be
dependent to a new mutation of the B2-microglobulin gene whereas the
defect in COPA-159 needs a better characterisation.

During the last two years we have carried out studies on cell cultures
from pre-invasive and invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix. One of our
objects has been to establish new cell strains. The culture material
consisted of 380 specimens from 96 patients. We have succeeded in
establishing four new strains, originating from four patients. They are
designated NHIK 3016, NHIK 3017, NHIK 3025 and NHIK 3043 and were started
in September 1967, October 1967, November 1967 and April 1968,
respectively. Biopsies were taken under coloscopic guidance and cut
longitudinally, one half for histological examination; the remaining part
for in vitro studies. The histological diagnoses of the biopsies were
invasive carcinoma for NHIK 3016 and NHIK 3043 and hyperplasia for NHIK
3017 and NHIK 3025. The corresponding clinical diagnoses were invasive
carcinoma for NHIK 3016, NHIK 3017 and NHIK 3043 and carcinoma in situ for
NHIK 3025. The tissue specimens, consisting of both epithelium and stroma,
were minced and trypsinized to single cells and cultivated in Carrel
flasks containing Puck's medium E2a. During the first 3 to 4 months the
mitotic activity was moderate; then a sudden increase was observed. At
this stage the cells had uniform epithelial-like morphology and growth
pattern. These properties have remained unchanged and the cells continue
to show permanent high mitotic activity.

9, 7, 7 and 8 passages, respectively. Later the cells were handled as
stock cultures, cultivated as monolayers in Jena G20 square flasks, and
trypsinized once a week. To date (May 1969) they have been cultivated over
73, 73, 67 and 43 passages, respectively, after the increase of mitotic
activity. To prevent loss of cells, each of the strains was separated into
two groups, and these were handled separately (by different persons, with
serum from different blood donors, in different incubators etc.). For the
same reason, but also in order to prevent the cells from being mixed and
in order to preserve cells with unaltered properties, they were frozen in
liquid nitrogen shortly after the increase in mitotic activity. The
following properties of the four cell strains were studied: (1) The
morphology and growth pattern of the cells; (2) the mitotic activity and
the duration of mitotic stages (partly by means of the Colcemid technique);
(3) plating efficiency; (4) chromosomes of cells in metaphase.
(Chromosomes were counted for analysis of the distribution of chromosome
number, and detailed karyotype analyses were made.) The results of these
studies will be presented and discussed.

Committed precursor cells for granulocyte and macrophage differentiation
can proliferate in soft agar cultures to form colonies of ganulocytes
and/or macrophages. Colonies arise from individual colony forming cells.
Colony formation is wholly dependent upon the constant presence of colony-
stimulating factor (CSF), a stimulotary glycoprotein substance. Recent
studies suggest that there are subclasses of CSF, differing in their
biochemical properties and target cell specificities. CSF is usually
quantitated by an in vitro assay based on the proliferative effects of
this factor on its target cell in bone marrow, by way of the CSF dependent
formation of granulocyte and/or macrophage colonies by bone marrow cells
in soft agar cultures. Quantitation is based on the relationship that
exists between colony number and CSF concentration using a constant number
of bone marrow cells (usually 10^5 cells/plate). Such an assay takes at
least 7 days and requires: a) differentiation between colonies (>50 cells)
and a cluster of cells (<50 cells); b) identification of the type of
colony (granulocyte, macrophage or mixture of both); and c) counting the
number of colonies. It would therefore be advantageous if CSF could be
quantitated by a rapid and more objective assay, which can identify the
subclass of CSF as well.

In the present study, we report on a cell line, PT-18, that is dependent
on mouse lung conditioned medium (GM-CSF) for its proliferation. Thus this
cell line can be utilized to rapidly assay CSF and, in addition, to
identify this particular subclass of CSF.

Hematopoietic cells generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)
can be used to model blood diseases and as an alternate source of blood
cells for transplantation. However, robust methods to differentiate hPSCs
to hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) have been difficult to develop.
The STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit reproducibly generates HPCs from multiple
embryonic (H1, H9) and induced pluripotent (WLS-1C, STiPS-F016, STiPS-M001,
STiPS-B004) stem cell lines under serum-and feeder-free conditions.
Briefly, hPSC aggregates were plated on Corning Matrigel in TeSR medium.
The cells were then sequentially incubated in two STEMdiff differentiation
media and harvested on day 10 or 12. Most HPCs were detected in the
supernatant fraction of the cultures at a frequency of 41 +- 2% CD34+CD45+
HPCs (mean +- SEM, n=69, day 12), with an average yield of 4.6x10^5 +- 0.41
HPCs per well of a 12-well plate. Multilineage differentiation potential
of the cells was tested in HPC culture assays. The frequency of
hematopoietic colony-forming unit (CFU) was assessed in serum-free
MethoCult medium (H4636) designed specifically to support balanced
erythroid and myeloid colony growth from hPSC-derived HPCs. All tested
cell lines showed high CFU frequencies of 441 +- 116 CFU per 10^4 day 10
HPCs (n=6) and 85 +- 10 CFU/10^4 per day 12 HPCs (n=6). Interestingly, the
distribution of myeloid and erythroid colonies was different for day 10
and day 12 cells. Most colonies derived from day 10 HPCs were erythroid
(65% +- 5), whereas myeloid colonies (73% +- 9) were the main subtype
observed in day 12 cells. The same trend was observed for all tested cell
lines. Erythroid potential of hPSC-derived HPCs was further tested in 14
day liquid expansion cultures using StemSpan SFEM II medium with Erythroid
Expansion Supplement. As a proof-of-principle, four hPSC lines were tested
and showed 8- to 56-fold expansion of total cell number and high purity of
79-95% CD71+GlyA+ erythroid cells. In summary, the STEMdiff Hematopoietic
Kit reproducibly differentiates hPSCs to functional HPCs expressing key

inducing anti-CD95 MAb, clone IPO-4 (IgM). In contrast to the parental
Jurkat/WT line, which displays relatively high expression of CD95 (60-80%
antigen-positive cells), cell-surface expression of the CD95 was entirely
negative in the Jurkat/A4 cell line (only 4% of antigen-positive cells).
The Jurkat/A4 cells are resistant to induction of apoptosis by both
anti-CD95 mAb IPO-4 and chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas the wild type clone
Jurkat/WT undergoes time-dependent apoptosis. Thus, these results suggest
the possible participation of CD95 pathway in the development of

Up to-date, very few intestinal cell models exist to mimic the
interactions in the intestinal tract of animals and man. Among the
existing ones, human cancerogenic cell lines like Caco2 are widely used.
As cancerogenic, these cell lines are not appropriate model to perform
studies in normal, noncancerogenic intestinal environment. Therefore, we
developed several epithelial cell lines of animal small intestinal origin
and cells of immune system to enable studies of interactions between food
and water born viruses (rotavirus, TGEV and HEV) and the animal or human
host. A complete pig intestinal functional cell developed consists of:
small epithelial intestinal cells: CLAB -enterocytes obtained from the
adult pig, PSI -Pig Small Intestine (clones 13), characterized as
nondifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells from the adult pig, PoM -Pig
Monocytes/macrophages cell lines, PoMon -Pig Monocytes obtained from the
peripheral blood and dendritic cells (DCs) that were developed by an in
vitro differentiation system to obtain routinely porcine immature DCs from
purified blood monocytes. Among ruminants, calf small intestinal cell line
CIEB -Calf Small Intestinal cells B; was obtained from the 450 kg
Limousine calf, OSI -Ovine Small Intestinal cells; were obtained from the
sheep, and goat, GIE -Small Intestinal cell line was obtained from the
small intestine of the animal. Cell lines obtained were tested for
susceptibility to rotavirus, TGEV and HEV infection and propagation. A
substantial variety in the ability of each individual virus to infect and
propagate in developed cell lines was observed, indicating specificity in
the virus host interactions. Based on obtained results, we can conclude
that newly developed animal intestinal cell models can serve as excellent
experimental tools in studies of virus host interactions in the intestinal
tract of animals and human.

Squamous cell carcinomas of various locations are among the most commonly
treated radiotherapy tumors. In general these tumors are only
intermediately radiosensitive. The concern of the present work consisted
in the establishment of an in vitro human oral squamous cell carcinoma
cell line from an in vivo xenograft tumor established in 1991 in nude mice
with a unusually high radiation sensitivity. The cell line cellular
characteristics were studied such as its stability, growth, colony
formation, DNA ploidy, p53 status, microsatellite analysis, as well as
tumorigenicity in nude mice and radiation sensitivity.

Morphology of cells and growth curve are important characteristics of cell
line, so the aim of this research was to study these peculiarities.

Methods: We investigated original cell line 4BL, obtained from peripheral
blood of healthy donor, which was successfully passed through the Heyflick
limit. Methods of cell cultivation and standard cytological methods were
used.

Results: Cell line 4BL and its clones consist of two main types of cells:
fibroblast-like and epithelioid. Cells have non-random distribution on the
surface of culture dish and form cycle-like structures. These properties
indirectly denote about stem potential of these cells, what have been
confirmed by special investigations. Growth curves had graded character:
virtually absence of lag-phase, two periods of exponential growth with
phase of growth impairment between them, virtually absence of stationary
phase and two peaks with maximum quantity of cells and accordingly two-
step decreasing.

Conclusions: Fibroblast-like and epithelioid cells are two main
morphological types of cell line 4BL, so as it's clones 1, 2 and 3.
Ability to form cycle structures at the surface of culture dish was
observed. Growth curves had graded character.

Attempts to develop sensitive tissue culture systems for isolation of
possible viral agents responsible for epidemic gastroenteritis have led to
the establishment of five serially transplantable cell lines from one
human embryo. The organs of origin included brain, lung, heart, liver and
intestine. An epithelial-like morphology was established after 3-5 serial
transfers and has persisted for one year. Multinuclear giant cells are
frequently observed with nuclei numbers ranging from 3-20. The spectrum of
susceptibility to known enteroviruses varies with each cell line.
Isolation of the cell line, the viral spectrum and morphological

Brain tumors, composed primarily of differentiated astrocyte like cells,
were induced in rats by weekly injections of 5 mg/kg N-nitrosomethylurea.
Passage of the tumor cells through culture greatly enhanced their ability
to be serially transplanted. Cultures were established by the method of
alternate culture and animal passage. The single-cell plating technique was
used to develop clonal strains from these cultures. The presence of a
highly acidic protein, named S-100, found only in vertebrate brain has
been reported. S-100 has been found serologically in one (C6) of the
clonal strains and not in the other (C3). About 0.2% of the total soluble
protein is S-100 when the cells are in stationary phase. Data pertaining
to the kinetics of S-100 production will be presented. The C6 strain has
been serially cultured for about one year without loss of its ability to
produce the brain specific protein S-100. The cells have a near diploid
chromosome number, and upon subcutaneous injection into rats produce
tumors in approximately 3 weeks. In contrast, the C3 strain does not
produce a tumor. Thus, serially propagated clonal strains of brain. cells
are able to perform at least one organ specific function for prolonged
periods in culture.

Ethidium bromide (EB) efficiently induces respiratory mutants in yeast. In
all studies reported, the effect of sublethal concentrations of EB in
mammalian cells was either reversible after omission of the drug or
resulted in cell death. We describe a cell line, F, derived from the SV40-
transformed hamster cell line F5-1, iwhich is completely resistant to EB
at a concentration of 2 mug/ml, as shown by its colony-forming ability. At
this concentration, cytochromes c and b are present in almost normal, or
only slightly diminished, amounts whereas cytochromes a + a3 show a
significant decrease. All cytochrome changes are reversible when EB is
discontinued. The biophysical properties of the mitochondrial DNA of the
resistant cell are characterized and compared to the parental cell line.
The mitochondria of the F cell have a normal ultrastructure, not distinct
from the parental F5-1 cell line. The induced resistance to EB has been
hereditarily transmitted to the progeny cells for 11 months. Possible
underlying mechanisms of the resistance to EB and the significance of the
establishment of this cell line are discussed.

A myeloid cell line, RED-3, has been established from the circulating
blasts of a patient with TdT(+) acute leukemia in second relapse. The
patient originally presented with T-ALL with 24% lymphoblasts by
morphology (FAB class L2). The blasts were polar block acid
phosphatase (ACP)(+), PAS(-), peroxidase (PX)(-), and non-specific esterase
(-) with 90% E-rosette formation. Blasts wore separated from blood by
Hypaque-Ficoll gradients and cultured at 10 cells/ml in RPMI 1640
supplemented with insulin, transferrin, selenium (ITS), and 20% fetal calf
serum (FBS). FBS was gradually withdrawn and by 8 wks the cells were
established in RPMI and ITS alone with a mean doubling time of 26 hrs.
Cells have been maintained for 15 mos at 37 Celsius, 7% CO2. Characterization
by histochemical stains and FACS-analysis showed that the cells in culture
were 9O%(+) for TdT and 95%(+) for the T-cell antigen Leu-3. However, the
cells were also positive for Sudan black, ACP, PAS, PX and for the myeloid
antigens M-1(97%), and My-7(99%). Retinoic acid (1 muM) and
dimethylformamide (60 mM) induced the cells to undergo myeloid maturation
and to acquire NBT reduction, additional myeloid antigens, Mo-1 (58%) and
OKM-1 (78%), and enhanced nonspecific binding of IgG1 and IgG2a but not IgM
indicating the presence of Fc receptors. The characteristics of this cell

Three oesophageal cell lines were established from two squamous carcinomas
and one from an adenocarcinoma. Each cell line expressed both cytokeratin
and vimentin intermediate filaments. They exhibited clonogenic growth in
serum free media and grew in an anchorage independent fashion in soft agar.
Each cell line produced both mitogenic and transforming growth factor
activities. All three cell lines were invasive in the in vitro chick heart
fragment invasion assay, albeit to different degrees, with OC2 cells
showing the highest degree of invasiveness. In tumourigenicity studies in
athymic nude mice, all three cell lines induced primary subcutaneous
tumours at the site of injection. OC1 and OC3 cells gave rise to
metastases, while the OC2 cells, although the most rapidly growing, failed
in every case to metastasize. OC1 and OC3 cells were found to express
urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), while OC2 cells did not. Our
findings suggest a role for uPA in conferring metastatic potential on
oesophageal carcinoma cells.

Three major groups of genes may be used for cancer gene therapy: (i)
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes; (ii) genes involved in the control
of tumor progression and metastasis; and (iii) genes encoding proteins
protecting the organism from tumor cells. Each group contains numerous
genes, and the discovery of new important genes is an exciting prospect in
cancer research. We are working on the search and characterization of the
genes over-or under-expressed in metastatic comparing to non-metastatic
tumors of the same origin. Two mouse systems are being used: (i) VMR-0
(non-metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma cells) -VMR-100-Liv and VMR-100-Ov
cells (metastatic preferentially to the liver or ovaries, respectively);
and (ii) CSML-0 -CSML-100 (mammary adenocarcinoma cells non-metastatic and
metastatic to the lungs, respectively). Several different genes were found
to be over-expressed in metastatic cells, but only few of them were shown
to be necessary and sufficient for maintaining the metastatic phenotype
using stably transfected cells and/or transgenic animals. Among them are
the mts1 and c-met genes. The mts1 gene, encoding a calcium-binding
protein of 101 amino acids of the S-100 family, was extensively
characterized. Its expression induced a number of changes in cell
functions connected with cytoskeleton features, attachment properties of
the cell, mesenchyme formation and possibly tumor vascularization. As a
multifunctional regulator, the mts1 gene is a promising target for gene
therapy of cancer. Other genes identified are over-expressed only in few
metastatic tumors and do not seem to be connected directly with the
acquisition of the metastatic phenotype. However, during the transfection
experiments some interesting features emerged for these genes, raising the
possibility of their exploitation in cancer gene therapy. The most
interesting is the tag7 gene encoding a new cytokine, 182 amino acids
long, with a far distant relation to cytokines of the TNF-Lymphotoxin
family. The tag7 gene is expressed in lymphoid cells, in a limited set of
other normal cells, and in few cancer cells including myelomas. The Tag7
protein is secreted to the culture medium and possesses a strong cytotoxic
activity inducing apoptosis. VMR-0 cells were stably transfected with a
construct containing the tag7 gene under control of the CMV promoter. The
original VMR-0 tumors killed mice in one month after subcutaneous
transplantation; animals displayed large necrotic foci at this stage.
However, the VMR-0/tag7 cells, synthesizing very low amounts of Tag7
protein, exhibited dramatically different growth properties: they grew
much slower; even after 4 months, no mice were killed by tumors arising
from the transplanted cells and no necrotic foci were formed. Histological
analysis of VMR-0/tag7 tumors showed a strong inhibition in mitotic rates
and an enhanced rate of apoptosis compared to VMR-0 tumors. The tumors
induced by transplantation of a mixture of VMR-0 and VMR-0/tag7 cells also
grew much slower than VMR-0 cells alone, suggesting an activation of the
immune system against tumor (tumor vaccination effect), which may be
mediated through induction of CTL cells. Experiments with nude mice gave
similar results. In fact at later stages of development in nude mice,
VMR-0/tag7 tumors were completely eradicated. It seems that the effect of
tag7 expression is complex and includes 381 Georgiev et al: Genes involved in
the control of tumor progression in gene therapy activation of an immune
response as well as a direct cytotoxicity. The higher tag7 expression in
culture cells is incompatible with cell survival. Experiments are in
progress for further elucidating the role of Tag7 and its exploitation for
the development of tumor vaccines.

cell types represents a unique tool in order to study and model certain
diseases, which affects specific type of cells, in vitro. one of the
typical example of such diseases is spinal muscular atrophy, which is
caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene (survival motor neuron 1 gene),
leading to selective death of motor neurons. Patient-specific iPSCs were
derived from the patient with a hereditary form of spinal muscular atrophy
I type and expressed the markers of pluripotency (NANOG, TRA-1-60, SSEA4,
OCT4, KLF4, MYC, REX1, and others). Spontaneous differentiation of the
obtained cells resulted in the appearance of derivatives of the three germ
layers: ecto-, meso-and endoderm. neural differentiation showed the
appearance of the early neural markers (PAX6, SOX2, NESTIN, tuJ1, PSA-

motor neurons' markers (ISL1 and CHAT). neurons derived from patient-

were thioguanine-sensitive and back selection for thioguanine-resistance
(loss of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene on the human
X chromosome) resulted in loss of temperature-resistance of hybrid cells
in greater than 95% of the hybrid colonies, suggesting synteny of the two

A continuous human cell line has been established from the primary
hepatocellular carcinoma (PLC) of a British woman. The patient had no
serological markers of HBV infection (HBsAg.HBcAb, and HBsAb ELISA-Abott
all-ve X2). She had received long term sex hormone treatment for
endometriosis. The tumour was alphafoetoprotein (AFP) secreting and arose
in a non-cirrhotic liver. The cell line, designated PLC/NUT/1 grows as an
adhering monolayer; the cells are of epithelial type and secrete
alphafoetoprotein. Karyotyping has shown a chromosome mode of 63; 71%
falling within the range 51-67. There are eight identifiable chromosomal
markers confirming a clonal origin. Despite negative serum markers, HBV
DNA was shown to be integrated into the cellular DNA of PLC/NUT/1 by
nucleic acid hybridisation using a cloned HBV(32P) DNA probe. Digestion
with a restriction endonuclease enzyme. Hind III, which does not cut HBV
DNA. yielded only one major and two minor fragments (larger than hepatitis
B virion DNA) containing HBV DNA sequences. This suggests that there are
at most only three integration sites of HBV DNA in these cells unlike the
PLC/PRF/5 (Alexander) cell line in which there are 8+. When PLC/NUT/1 is
heterotransplanted subcutaneously into male athymic mice tumours develop
at the site of inoculation. These are primary liver cancer similar in
morphology to the original tumour and immunoperoxidase staining is
positive for HBsAg and AFP. These results suggest involvement of HBV in
this hormone associated PLC. The paucity of sites of integration of HBV
DNA into the DNA of this human PLC cell line will facilitate study of the
oncogenicity of HBV.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which catalyze dephosphorylation of
tyrosyl phosphorylated proteins, play an important role in cellular
signaling by serving as antagonists of Protein Tyrosine Kinases (PTKs).
PTPs regulate multiple cytokine and growth factor activated signaling
pathways which are associated with malignancies like myelodysplastic
syndromes and B-cell lymphomas. PTPN1 is a well studied nonreceptor
phophatase. JAK2 was shown to be a substrate of PTPN1 which results in a
negative regulation of the kinase activity of JAK2 and the subsequent
activation of downstream targets like STAT5. Furthermore it has been
demonstrated that PTPN1 is involved in regulation of apoptosis in
different cell systems. The parental tumor of U-HO1, a nodular sclerosing
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), and its resulting cell line proofed
negative for PTPN1 in Western blot and by immunomorphology. We hence
investigated the expression of PTPN1. PTPN1 cDNA (NM_002827) of U-HO1 was
markedly truncated: exon 2 to exon 8 were skipped translating into the
following predicted short protein of 26 amino acids:
MEMEKEFEQIDKSGSWAAIYQHESRH. To examine the role of lack in functional
PTPN1 we transfected U-HO1 cells with wt-PTPN1. Transient ectopic
expression of PTPN1 caused an increased dephosphorylation of phosphoSTAT5.
Stable wt-PTPN1 transfectants featured a very slow proliferation in
contrast to cells transfected with the empty vector. As evidenced by
Nicoletti staining and cytomorphology wt-PTPN1 undergo apoptosis to a much
greater extent than mock transfectants. To see whether PTPN1 deficiency is
occuring in the HRS-cells of cHL in vivo, we analyzed 61 samples from
patients with cHL by immunohistochemistry. Only 15 of 61 cHL samples
tested had PTPN1-positive neoplastic cells. Thus lack of PTPN1 is a common
feature in HRS-cells in vivo. In summary our results show that PTPN1 plays
a major role in deactivation of the JAK2-/STAT5 signaling pathway and its
deficiency saves HRS-cells from apoptosis.

DR   Cellosaurus; CVCL_M116; BSC
DR   Cellosaurus; CVCL_M117; BSC-C10
AB   Yes
Background: Mesenchymal cells of the hepatic sinusoids (HSC) are thought
to represent the major source of excessive extracellular matrix in liver
fibrosis. The transdifferentiation of HSC to myofibroblasts (MF) is
believed to be a key event in hepatic fibrogenesis. However. HSC and MF
may still serve as two distinct cell types with the fibrogenic potential
in vivo, and it is not certain whether there is a transitional cell type
in liver fibrosis. We report here a HSC line, designated BSC, with the
phenotypes of both HSC and MF, which was established from HSC isolated
from rat experimental cholestatic liver fibrosis via spontaneous
immortalization.

Methods: HSC were isolated by sequential liver digestion with pronase and
collagenase followed by arabinogalactan gradient ultracentrifugation from
advanced liver fibrosis induced by 18-day cholestasis following bile duct
ligation in a male Wistar rat. The cells were collected from the interface
between the medium and a density of 1.034 and cultured originally in a 24
well plate in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and later in DMEM with 1g/L glucose
and 10% FBS. The cells were determined to be HSC with more than 95% purity
based on the typical morphology of freshly isolated MSC and UV-exited
fluorescence due to residual vitamin A storage. Unlike HSC isolated from a
sham-operated rat, the cells from a bile-duct ligated rat became
spontaneously immortalized and after 60 passages, clones were established
by the limiting dilution method. One of the clones, designated BSC-c10,
was characterized by immunofluorescent microscopy and Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR for expression of HSC and MF markers at protein and
mRNA levels. Doubling time was assessed and 3H-proline and 3H-thymidine
were used for determination of collagen production and DNA synthesis in
response to TGFPI. Transient transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Gibco-
BRL) was tested.

Results: BSC has been maintained in culture for more than two years. A
doubling time is estimated to range 40-48 hr depending on culture
conditions. Most BSC clones maintain a polygonal shape of culture-
activated HSC when cultured in a low cell density, but their morphology
changes to a spindle shape of MF in a high density. BSC-c10 expresses: 1)
the markers known to be expressed by HSC such as glial acidic fibrillary
protein, synaptophysin, vascular cell adhesion molecule, neural cell
adhesion molecule; 2) those which are generally considered to be MF
markers, interleukin-6 and fibulin-2; and 3) those expressed by both cell
types, desmin, alpha(1)-procollagen, a-smooth muscle actin, and CD36. The
pattern of expression of these genes is not altered in a high density
despite the morphological change to the spindle shape. TGFbeta1 (1-10
ng/ml) causes a 40% decrease in DNA synthesis and a 33% increase in
collagen production in BSC-c10. The cells are easily transfected with a
GFP construct with as high as 60-70% transfection efficiency.

Conclusions: BSC-c10, one clone of the spontaneously immortalized HSC line
established from experimental biliary liver fibrosis, exhibits the
phenotypes of both HSC and MF, suggesting that a transitional cell type
may play a role in liver fibrosis. In vivo experiments need to be
performed to confirm this observation. Having phenotypic expression of
both cell types and high transfection efficiency, this cell line may be a
useful model for studying HSC transdifferentiation.

Thiol protease inhibitors (TPIs) were isolated from culture media and cell
extracts of two human lung cancer cell lines and were characterized by
biochemical and biological means to understand the relationship between
cancer growth and TPI. 1) High molecular weight (HMW-) TPI and low
molecular weight (LMW-) TPI were purified from culture media of human lung
cancer cell line LK-2 (squamous cell carcinoma) by gel filtlation on
Sephadex G-100 and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. Their
molecular weight (MW) were estimated to be 90,000 and 10,000,
respectively, by gel filtlation. LMW-TPI was dominant in TPI activity.
LMW-TPI is stable below 60 Celsius and in a range of pH 6-10. LMW-TPI was a
specific inhibitor of thiol protease. From LK-2 cell extract, only LMW-TPI
(MW 10,000) could be detected. 2) None of TPIs, purified from culture
media or cells of LK-2, reacted with anti-UTPI rabbit IgG or anti-alpha2-TPI
rabbit IgG by double immunodiffusion method. 3) From a human lung
adenocarcinoma cell line, luci-10, both HMW-TPI and LMW-TPI were purified
from culture media but only LMW-TPI from cell extracts. 4) Daily
examination of TPI activity in culture media of Luci-10 showed that cancer
cells at stationary phase released TPI two to three times more than at
logarithmic growth phase. 5) LMW-TPI, purified from culture media of LK-2,
suppressed incorporation of 3H-Thymidine of LK-2 cells. Other TPIs
(alpha2-TPI in serum, UTPI in urine, a microbial protease inhibitor E64)
suppressed it. On the other hand, Serine protease inhibitors such as UTI
in urine and soybean trypsin inhibitor had no effect. 6) Thiol proteases
such as papain, ficin, and cathepsin B stimulated incorporation of
3H-Thymidine of LK-2 cells.

AB   Yes
A new cell line, designated BCIRL-PX2-HNU3, derived from 20
minced trypsinized pupae of diamond-back moth, Plutella xylostella, has
been established. Primary culture was set up in TC-199-MK medium on July
1, 1982. It was refed once a week. August 17, 48 days after explantation,
the first subculture was made just by flushing an equal volume of fresh
medium upon the confluent sheets, then the cells were dispensed into two
new culture flasks. The cells grew very rapidly. Since then they were
subcultured three times a week at a split ratio 1:2 and were subcultured
at a ratio 1:10 when they reached their passage 100. Now, this line is in
their 115 passage. BCIRL-PX2-HNU3 cells were not firmly attached and
floating cells were always observed in the medium. Most cells of this line
were round and oval in shape, some were elongated or spindle shaped,
although there were some other types of cells in the mixed cell population.
The population doubling time at 28 Celsius in 96 hours was 30 +- 2.06 and
the cell density reached, from 1x10^5 cells/ml inoculated, a level of
approximately 1.3x10^6 cells/ml after 8 days. Chromosomes were typical of
other lepidopteran cells. BCIRL-PX2-HNU3 was distinguished from cell lines
derived from other insect species by isoelectric focusing using the enzyme
phosphoglucoisomerase. Preliminary studies indicated that BCIRL-PX2-HNU3
cells could support the replication of some baculoviruses. The inclusion
bodies appeared in the nucleus of the cells within 48 hrs after
challenging the culture with Autographa californica's NPV. Inclusion
bodies of VHA-273, another heterologous baculovirus isolated from
Heliothis armigera in China could be replicated in Plutella cells as well,
either challenged the cells with infectious hemolymph or infectious
supernatant from infected cultures. One more interesting thing was that 6
days after challenging the cells with infectious hemolymph of its
homologous baculovirus, Plutella granulosis virus, GV capsules were found
in the cytoplasm of cultured Plutella cells, and it was confirmed by EM
pictures. But we failed to get it reconfirmed in subsequent experiments.

BCIRL-SO3-HNU1 and BCIRL-SO4-HNU4 were two new cell lines derived from the
ovarioles of the yellow-striped armyworm or cotton cutworm, Spodoptera
ornithogalle. The ovarioles of a newly emerged female moth were sectioned
and the cells treated with trypsin and cultured in Falcon TC-25cm2 flasks
each with 5 ml of TC-199-MK, medium. The most predominant characteristics
of these cell lines during development is that the rapid growth was not
only observed in the primary cultures, but their quick multiplication can
also be seen in the successive passages. The durations of SO3 and SO4 from
the primary culture to the first passage lasted only 28 and 29 days
respectively. After the fourth passage, a 1:2 split ratio was made three
times a week, while the duration of each of the first 4 passages was 3-5
days. Then, after a succession of 100 passages, a change of split ratio of
1:10 was made and the passage intervals were once a week. Both the cells
of SO3 and SO4 were loosely attached to the bottom of the flasks. The
subculture could be easily performed just by agitation or flushing medium
onto the cells without any trypsin treatment. The cells were mostly
rounded, with some elongated and spindled forms. The SO4 cells seemed to
be a little bit larger than those of SO3. At 28 Celsius during 120 hrs,
the cell doubling time for SO3 was 47 +- 3.2 hrs, while SO4 at 28 Celsius
during 72 hrs being 54 +- 5.07 hrs. The maximum cell densities of SO3 and
SO4 attained 1. 36x10^6/ml and 1.28x10^6/ml respectively. The chromosomes
were typical of Lepidoptera, they appeared to be blunt, short and
numerous, but variable in number. The results of the preliminary
experiments have shown that these two cell lines seemed to be neither
susceptible to the M-NPV of Spodoptera ornithogalle nor to that of the
Heliothis armigera.

uterine tumor was removed from a 53 year-old Japanese woman undergoing
radical hysterectomy and lymph node resection. The portion of tumor was
placed into culture the next day. Histopathological diagnosis of the tumor
indicated a minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (so-called adenoma malignum).
The material was minced with a sharp pair of scissors, treated with 600
Pronase units/ml dispase, and centrifuged. The tissues were placed in 6 cm
plastic dishes containing the mixed culture media of Ham's F12 and RPMI
1640 (GIBCO), 100 units of penicillin and 100 mug of streptomycin per ml,
and 15% fetal calf serum; the final pH was 7.2-7.4. The collagen-coated
dishes were incubated at 37 Celsius in a CO2 incubator supplied with
humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. In the initiation of the primary culture,
an epithelial colony and fibroblastic cells appeared. Pure epithelial
cells were obtained by the isolation technique devised by Okumura. The
cell line has grown slowly and serial passages were successively carried
out 21 times within 9 months. The cultured cells were spindle, round, and
columnar in shape, showing anaplastic and pleomorphic features and
multilayering without contact inhibition. The cells formed gland-like
structures in vitro. The population doubling time was 83 hours. The
chromosomes showed a wide distribution of aneuploidy, the mode was in the
hypo-triploid range, and many marker chromosomes were observed. The cells
produced a large amount of CEA and TPA but were not able to be transplanted

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has been shown to be a very
heterogeneous malignant disease in which the majority of cases cannot be
clearly related to either the T or B cell ontogeny pathway. A small
percentage of cases, however, have been clearly shown by numerous
immunological methods to be of T cell origin. This group is in itself a
heterogeneous one with the malignant cells showing early, late or
intermediate differentiation phenotypes. One way to explore these
differences in differentiation states is to establish and characterize
various cell lines from the T-ALL patients and to compare these lines with
normal cells of the T lineage. In the normal T cell differentiation
pathway, the stem cell originates in the bone marrow, migrates to the
thymus (where it is referred to as the prothymocyte) and under thymic
microenvironment differentiates into the cortical thymocyte. Upon further
maturation the thymocyte is exported into the peripheral blood as a mature
T cell. The human prothymocyte has recently been characterized and shown
to compose only a small proportion of the postnatal thymocytes. In
contrast to the cortical thymocytes, the prothymocytes are large cells
with mitotic activity. They do not form E rosettes, do not exhibit natural
attachment (NA) and are highly sensitive to hydrocortisone (HC) induced
cytolysis. The cortical thymocytes do form E rosettes, do express NA and
are HC resistant. In this study, we have characterized a cell line Be13
originating in a patient with T-ALL. By use of the above-mentioned
markers, this line was shown to express a phenotype intermediate to the
prothymocyte and cortical thymocyte. Recent works have shown that the
phorbol esters can act as inducers of certain human leukaemic lines. It
was of interest, therefore, to see whether the Be13 line could be
similarly induced to a more mature differentiation stage along the T cell
lineage.

AB   Yes
Liver parenchymal cells from C57BL/6J mouse fetal livers, generally of 16
days gestation, have been grown for over 3 years in continuous culture, in
chemically defined media containing cortisol or dexamethasone at 6x10^-7 M.
In the presence of hormone, sheets of hepatocytes attach and grow. Other
cell types gradually disappear, leaving only hepatocytes. In the absence
of steroid hormone hepatocytes do not survive. After long term growth (1
to 2 years), when the hormone is withdrawn, the cells continue to grow at
a slightly reduced rate. Growth is less vigorous from older fetal or from
postnatal mouse livers. The metabolism of short term cultures has been
investigated, including the utilization of 14C-acetate and 14C-glucose,
the synthesis, turnover, and intracellular location of glycogen, and the
regulation of lipid synthesis. Sterol synthesis is inhibited by
cholesterol. The inhibition is reversible on withdrawal of the cholesterol.
Recovery of sterol synthesis is dependent upon protein synthesis. The
enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase, highly specific for liver, is present
in the parenchymal cell cultures (though the specific activity of the
enzyme decreases following cultivation), and ornithine utilization is
active. Serum proteins are produced. Since liver cells grow well in media
high in K+ and relatively low in Na+ we have studied RNA, DNA, and protein
synthesis in cultures in our usual synthetic medium (MAB87/3 +-
dexamethasone) and in media of various Na+:K+ ratios.

In developing techniques and media for the isolation and cultivation of
cell lines from human solid tumors, two recent isolates are of interest
for their unusual characteristics. Both were isolated by the spinner
spillout technique and grown in medium L-15 plus various additives. SW13,
epithelial-like cells obtained from a small cell carcinoma of the adrenal
cortex, grew in colonies and domed. Ultrastructurally, they contained
numerous bulb-type gap junctions. By the 25th passage, the cells lost most
of their ability to dome, and significantly fewer gap junctions were noted.
SW48 was derived from an adenocarcinoma of the colon. The cells grew as
grape-like clusters their first 7 months in vitro and then partially as
monolayers of epithelial-like cells. In platform suspension cultures, they
grew as multicell spheroids which enlarge and develop necrotic centers.
Ultrastructurally they were epithelial-like cells tightly enmeshed by
their microvilli and joined by desmosomes. The multicell spheroids formed
a tight layer of cells around their periphery and a similar layer to wall
off the necrotic area. The latter layer of cells disappeared when the area
of necrosis became extensive. This cell line is an excellent in vitro
model of human nodular carcinomas. No reference could be found in the
literature of similar cell lines obtained from human tissues.

A majority of human lymphoid cell lines have B cell characteristics: they
produce immunoglobulin and lack the ability to form rosettes with sheep
red blood cells. Without exception, the 272 cell lines derived from normal
persons have B cell characteristics. B cell characteristics predominate in
abnormal cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphoma and chronic
myclogenous leukemia. A cell line derived from multiple myeloma produces
only light chains and does not, form rosettes. Several cell lines
established from patients with lymphatic leukemia have either T cell
characteristics or a mixture of T and B cell characteristics. Cell lines
8402, 8412, 8422, 8432, 8442, 8452, 8382, and 8392 from the same
individual demonstrate that abnormal lymphoid cell lines may vary in their
reactions. Early in culture these lines carried the chromosome markers
present in the donor. Several cell lines are distinguished by their lack
of clumping in stationary cultures; these are most like T cells. After 4
months in culture, several lines with T cell characteristics began to form
clumps and simultaneously lost their ability to form rosettes with sheep
red blood cells. These cells that form clumps produce detectable amounts
of immunoglobulin and contain a more normal chromosome constitution.
Ultramorphological measurements indicate that the T cells contain fewer
mitochondria, less rough endoplasmic reticulum, and more lysosomes; are
smaller than B cells; and probably represent the leukemic lymphocytes.

We have previously reported that owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus) are hosts
for several different latent viruses. Most of these viruses have been
isolated from kidney cell cultures. To characterize these herpes, adeno,
paramyxo, and papova viruses recovered as latent agents from the owl
monkey, there was an urgent need for an established owl monkey kidney cell
line which was free of adventitious agents. We were successful in
obtaining such a cell line which is now in its 258th passage level. The
chromosome analysis of the cell line at different passage intervals by the
trypsin G-band technique demonstrated that the cell line was initiated
from a female Aotus with a "type II" karyotype and a diploid count of 54.
The cell line remained hypo-diploid with a modal count of 51 to 53.
Drastic rearrangement of parts of certain chromosomes has been noted. This
cell line permits the replication of several herpesviruses, especially the
two oncogenic viruses H. saimiri and H. ateles as well as several other
mammalian viruses. This cell line is also useful for plaquing studies. It
will withstand the photodynamic action of neutral red for as long as 34
days and permit the development of viral plaques. The morphological,
chromosomal, and biological characteristics of this cell line will be
discussed.

The purpose of this study was to characterize a line of cells established
from a normal source of human mammary epithelium. Human milk samples
collected from nursing mothers during the first week postpartum contain
both colony forming epithelium, desquamated from ducts and alveoli; and
foam cells responsible for the synthesis of milk products. These cells can
be maintained in monolayer culture for several weeks. Two samples of milk
from the 300 patients initially surveyed contained cells capable of
continuous growth in vitro. One cell line, HBL-100, has been transferred
through 90 weekly passages. These cells do not form tumors in nude mice
but will grow in soft agar. Of 60 metaphases examined during passage 8 the
number of chromosomes per cell varied from 58 to 73 with a hypertriploid
mean of 66. The 80 of 83 metaphases scanned during passage 50 had
chromosome numbers in the low 60 range. No HeLa marker chromosomes were
found, and cells exhibited a B-type G6PD electrophoretic pattern. Most of
the metaphases had one or more minute chromosomes. Electron micrographs
revealed the presence of desmosomes. Although radioimmunoassay for alpha-
lactalbumin was negative, the cells do synthesize a small amount of
lactose. HBL-100 cells respond to prolactin and/or estrogen by
synthesizing increased amounts of isoelectrically precipitable casein.
These observations demonstrated that this cell line may classify as: (1)
epithelial, originating from a normal source; (2) transformed but not
malignant; and (3) mammary inferred from their capacity to respond to
lactogenic hormones.

An epithelial cell strain dependent upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) for
proliferation has been isolated from explant cultures of monkey bronchi.
Segments of approximately 3 mm2 were placed in 60 mm plates containing
glass chips. The standard growth medium used was F12K with 15% FBS. Chips
supporting epithelial outgrowths apparently free of fibroblasts were
transferred to 16 mm wells of cluster plates. Cells thus isolated required
both EGF (10-30 ng/ml) and the presence of irradiated lung fibroblasts
(ATCC CCL-171 - MRC5) for subsequent propagation to mass population
densities. Epithelial cultures could be propagated serially for more than
6 months with over 33 population doublings. The omission of EGF at any
point resulted in an obvious decline in proliferation rates and the
appearance of vacuolated cells. Biochemical studies showed that addition
of EGF resulted in a 20-fold increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation.
Dexamethasone (10^-8 M) acted synergistically with EGF to double
3H-thymidine uptake. Histochemical staining showed that vigorous cultures
contained abundant PAS-positive cytoplasmic droplets. The cells also
exhibited high levels of malic dehydrogenase as did epithelia lining
bronchial lumina. Examination of the fine structure of cultured bronchial
cells revealed desmosomes plus a variety of electronlucent droplets and
dense membrane-bound bodies with somewhat heterogeneous matrices. The cell
strain has been preserved in liquid nitrogen and can be recovered readily.
Further characterizations are in progress.

A transplantable tumor line derived from hyperplastic nodules of the

Canc. Lett. 7, 197, 1979) has been used to isolate two distinct cell
culture lines. Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous tumors in a male Wistar
rat were used as source material. Minced tumor fragments were seeded to
culture vessels in F12K supplemented with horse and/or fetal bovine sera.
Epithelial-like outgrowths were predominant and fibroblastic contaminants
were selected against by penicylinder ringing. One derived line AR4-2J is
highly refractile, contains significant amounts of amylase (6.22 U/mg cell
protein) and other exocrine enzymes, and readily produces tumors in
athymic mice (5/5 in 30 days). The line contains few zymogen droplets and
apparently is not responsive to pancreozymin (0.2 U/ml). The second cell
line AR4-IP developed after passaging supernatant culture fluids obtained
at 24 hours after the initial seeding. These cells are non-refractile,
grow in monolayer culture with typical cobblestone appearance, are low in
amylase and other exocrine enzymes, and do not produce tumors when
injected into nude mice. The lines may be of use in comparative studies
requiring tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines from similar source

Treatment of normal human epithelial cells with chemical carcinogens has
rarely led to neoplastic cell transformation. One approach to the
development of human epithelial cell cultures for studies of carcinogen-
induced cell transformation is to immortalize the cells with certain viral
genes, such as the SV40 early region genes. In the present study, normal
human esophagus tissue obtained from autopsy was explanted in serum-free
LHC-9 medium. The epithelial outgrowths were subcultured, then transfected
by strontium phosphate coprecipitation with plasmid pRSV-T consisting of
the RSV-LTR promoter and the sequence encoding the SV40 large T-antigen
The transfected cells but not the sham-transfected controls formed
multilayered colonies within 2-3 weeks which grew exponentially for 8-10
weeks, then senesced After a "crisis" of 6-8 months, growth resumed in
isolated colonies. Two lines (HET-1A and HET-2A), were developed and have
now undergone 137 and 193 population doublings, respectively Both have an
epithelial morphology, stain for cytokeratins and the SV40 T antigen gene
by immunofluorescence, and have remained nontumorigenic in nude, athymic
mice for 12 months. Karyotypic analysis by Giemsa banding has shown that
HET-1A is hypodiploid (34-40 chromosomes), whereas HET-2A is hypotriploid
(57-64 chromosomes). Both cell lines are sensitive to serum and TGF-
induced terminal cell differentiation. Clones of both lines have been
adapted to grow in either EGF-, insulin-, or bovine pituitary extract-free
medium. This serum and growth factor-free system and the 2 immortalized
esophageal cell lines should be useful for studies of carcinogen-induced
cell transformation.

The spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, is the most destructive

biorational control agents for this insect. The midguts were removed from
surface sterilized insects. After cleaning, they were chopped into small
pieces, and treated with 0.05% trypsin. The tissue fragments were removed
by centrifugation, resuspended in growth medium, transferred to 25-cm2
plastic tissue culture flasks, and were kept at 28 Celsius. Three different
media (Grace's, EX-CELL 400, and SF-900) supplemented with 10-12% fetal

of midgut cells and other cell types. The cells have been freeze-preserved
in liquid nitrogen and successfully revived. Some of the cell lines
replicate the spruce budworm nuclear polyhedrosis virus and some are
susceptible to certain delta-endotoxin proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis.

Immortalized kidney cells have diverse research applications in the study
of renal physiology, biochemistry, toxicology and pathology. The human
fetal kidney, resembles histologically, Wilms tumor, a complex childhood
neoplasm that recapitulates the differentiation of the normal nephron_
Immortalized kidney cells are being shown to have the same sensitivity to
human viruses as the primary cells used for human virus detection and
isolation. This is the first report of the successful immortalization of a
human fetal line by human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16). Human fetal kidney
at 115 and 133 days were enzymatically dissociated by treatment with a
mixture collagenase:trypsin (1,1). After inoculation and neutralization,
the cells were plated on collagen, fibronectin and RSA coaled flasks in
Clonetics REGM (low serum media). The cells were grown and passaged twice
before freezing. Immortalization was performed on cells that had been
passaged at least once after thawing. Transfection of the fetal cells with
the E6/E7 genes of HPV16 occurred in the presence of polybrene. Control
cells were in polybrene without viral genes. To test the efficacy of the
transfection, control and treated cells were exposed to G418 three days
after transfcction. The cells not transfected stopped dividing and came
off the surface of the flask. The immortalized cells continued to divide.
Immortalized cells underwent at least 50 population doublings (PDL) and
retained epithelial morphology. Primary cells underwent 6 PDL before
ceasing division. Immortalized cells were characterized by
immunohistochemistry of keratin and acid phosphatase expression. These
cells were positive for anti-keratin AE1/AE3 which recognizes the acidic
subfamily characteristic of keratinocytes. The cells were also positive
for leukocyte acid phosphatase which is 'characteristic' of proximal
tubule brush border membrane (PTC BBM). These cells demonstrate possible
research significance as an immortalized fetal line with differentiated
characteristics.

Cultured keratinocytes are useful research models for the study of wound
repair and skin substitutes for the treatment of severe burns and ulcers.
Migrating wound epidermal cells do not terminally differentiate e.g.
produce keratin, as do keratinocytes of normal epidermis. Immortalized
human keratinocytes have research applications in the study of drug
toxicity and pharmacology. We report the immortalization of human fetal
keratinocytes which retain differentiated characteristics. Fetal skin
samples (112 and 126 days gestation) were digested by collagenase: trypsin
treatment. The digested products were plated on collagen, fibronectin, BSA
coated flasks in Gibco KSFM media supplemented with epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and bovine pituitary extract. Cells were passaged by trypsin-
versene treatment. At passage 2, cells were frozen. Thawed cells, which
had been passaged at least once were transfected with the E6/E7, gene of
human papillonia virus 16 (HPV16) in the presence of polybrene. Five
days later the cells were exposed to G418. Untransformed cells died. After
50 population doublings, the cells continued dividing and retained
epithelial, cuboidal appearance. The cells were characterized for keratin
expression by immunohistochemistry. The cells were positive for epithelial
specific antigen using a monoclonal antibody produced from the hybridoma
Ep16 (ATCC HB-155). Further studies will determine the expression and
attachment of these cells to various matrix molecules and migration to
various chemotactic factors.

Cell lines from the early embryonic stages of fish have potential uses in
the development of embryonic stem (ES) cell technology, either as ES cell
lines or embryonic fibroblasts (EF) to act as feeders for ES lines. As
well, they would be useful in other biological disciplines, such as
toxicology. Therefore, we attempted to initiate cell cultures from
individual rainbow trout embryos at approximately stage 6 or blastula
stage of development. Embryos were treated in various proteolytic
solutions, and then with the chorions still intact, single embryos were
placed into individual wells of 24-well plates in Leibovitz's medium with
10% fetal bovine serum. At various times afterwards, the chorions were
ruptured with a Pasteur pipette, releasing cells into the medium. The
proportion of the approximately 100 embryos that gave rise to primary
cultures is unknown, as most wells were overrun by bacterial contamination.
Of the uncontaminated wells, a few embryos generated some adherent cells
without further proliferation. One embryo, however, gave rise to an
attached ball of cells, from which grew an adherent monolayer. These cells
were subcultured, giving rise to mixed colonies of epithelial-like and
fibroblast-like cells. These cells have now been passaged over 25 times,
cryopreserved, and designated RTeeb. RTeeb express CYP1A in response to
dioxin (TCDD), which is a useful property in toxicological studies. They
are alkaline-phosphatase-positive, express CD9 mRNA, and sporadically form
compact circular colonies in monolayer cultures, properties reminiscent of
mammalian ES cells. Yet, the cells are aneuploid, and are thus more
similar to mammalian embryonal carcinoma cell lines.

The small hive beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, originated in sub-Saharan
Africa and now has a world-wide distribution. Adult SHBs deposit their
eggs in honey bee colonies and the larvae feed on honey, pollen and honey
bee larvae. Over time this negatively impacts honey bee populations, which
translates into a major economic impact on agriculture. A number of
measures have been implemented to control SHBs, including the use of
biological agents. Current efforts focus on developing novel, SHB-specific
insecticides, which could be enhanced with tools to screen candidate
compounds against cell lines derived from SHB tissues. Here we report on
two continuously replicating SHB cell lines: BCIRL-AtuE-1127-SGS from eggs
and BCIRL-AtuNE-1129-SGS from eggs and neonate larvae. Each line consists
of a variety of cell morphotypes, including firmly attached asymmetrical
cells and loosely-attached spherical cells. Numerous sublines were
produced by limiting dilution to isolate different cell morphotypes; 20
sublines were selected and cryopreserved. Of these, 3 were selected from
the AtuNE-1129 parental line and 6 from the AtuE-1127 line for further
molecular and genetic characterization. DNA barcoding confirmed that the
sublines were derived from SHB tissues. Growth curves indicated their
doubling times ranged from 29.2 h to 68.4 h. Gene expression profiles were
evaluated in three sublines via RNA-Seq. The transcriptomic libraries and
gene expression profiles will aid in the identification of potential
insecticidal targets present in the cell lines. Here we present a small
subset of genes expressed in these cell lines that could support
insecticide development programs, including: various members of ABC
transporter families A-G; calcium transporters, such as plasma membrane
and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases; and GPCRs with
neurophysiological functions, such as octopamine and pyrokinin receptors.

Bloch, 1793. The cell line was maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 supplemented
with 15% FBS and cells have been subcultured 45 times. The HGF cell line
consists predominantly of fibroblastic-like cells. The cells were able to
grow at temperatures between 25 Celsius and 32 Celsius with optimum
temperature of 28 Celsius. The growth rate of fin cells increased as the
FBS proportion increased from 2 to 20% at 28 Celsius with optimum growth
at the concentrations of 15 or 20% FBS. After confluence, the cells were
sub-cultured with a split ratio of 1:2. The cells showed fibroblastic-like
morphology and reached confluence on the fourth day after subculture.
Polymerase chain reaction amplification of mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI
indicated identity of these cell lines with those reported from this
animal species, confirming that the cell lines were of honeycomb grouper

This study established a goat embryonic kidney (GEK) cell line which was

Matou goat and GEK cell line was established by cell biology techniques.
Tumorigenicity of GEK cell line was tested by tumorigenesis assay, and its
marker protein expression was tested by immunohistochemistry. Receptors of
influenza virus and susceptibility to H1N1 influenza virus were also
tested by immunofluorescence method and cell infection assay, respectively.
Results showed that GEK cells transplanted into BALB/c nude mice could not
induce tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the cells
expressed cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) and vimentin which are marker proteins of
renal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescent assay indicated that the
abundance of alpha2,3-sialic acid (SA) receptor and alpha2,6-SA receptor
on the surface of GEK cells were higher than that of Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells. The influenza virus titers in GEK cells were similar
to that of MDCK cells. Therefore, the GEK cell line established here will
possibly contribute to the future influenza virus isolation and vaccines

AB   Yes
Established human colon cancer cell line SW1116 was used to generate ior
C5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) by standard hybridoma technique. By
immunohistochemical studies the antigen was abundant and strongly
expressed in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, mainly the
small and large intestine, and the bronchus epithelial cell lining; no
reaction was observed in the other normal tissues studies. Glandular
epithelial derived tumors, especially colorectal cancers showed a more
variable and heterogeneous reactivity to the antibody. Enzymatic and
chemical treatments of colorectal cancer membrane extracts indicated that
the antigen recognized by this mAb is an O-linked glycoprotein
carbohydrate chain. Western blot studies on SW1116 cell membrane extracts
showed that the ior c5 mAb recognized a glycoprotein complex composed of a
major 145 kDa band and a minor 190 kDa band. The epitope recognized by
this mAb can also be found in a high molecular weight glycoprotein
obtained from normal colon. In blocking experiments using ior c5 and ior
c2 mAb (previously reported by us), it was shown that both mAbs compete for
the same antigen site, although ior C5 shows a higher blocking efficiency.
Additionally, ior c5 in contrast with ior c2 mAb, was capable of blocking
the recognition of 17-1A mAb by a pool of human anti idiotypic antibodies
generated agains 17-1A mAb. Since, 17-1A and ior c5 mAbs recognized
different antigens, the above result indicates that these anti idiotypic
antibodies recognize a non paratopic idiotype shared by both 17-1A and ior
c5 mAbs. The preferential staining of colorectal tumors and the
restricted reactivity in normal human adult tissues make ior c5 mAb an
eligible candidate for the radioimmunodetection of colorectal tumors.

Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm derived from abnormal plasma cells
exhibiting excessive proliferation either within or outside of the bone
marrow. While the majority of myelomas are classified into distinct types
based on the production of different classes of immunoglobulins, a small
percentage of these tumor cells fail to exhibit immunoglobulin secretion
and are classified as nonsecretory myelomas. The nonsecretory type is
further subdivided into the intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin producer and
nonproducer types. Notably, recent studies detected a novel form of
myeloma, oligosecretory myeloma, which comprises a portion of the
nonsecretory type. While the prevalence of the oligosecretory type
increases with disease progression, the mechanism underlying the
development of these cells remains unclear. Likewise, oligosecretory
myeloma cell lines remain rare. Here, we describe the development of a
new myeloma cell line, designated THK-72, from the pleural effusion of a
myeloma patient initially diagnosed with IgG kappa type myeloma, which
subsequently transformed to oligosecretory myeloma. THK-72 cells
proliferated in single suspension culture without any feeder layer or IL-6
supplementation, and no immunoglobulin secretion was detected in the
supernatant of these cells by immunoelectrophoresis analysis.
Morphological analyses indicated that THK-72 cells had plasmacytoid
appearance, while PCR and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that the
cells were negative for B-cell marker and EBV-infection, thereby
indicating that THK-72 comprises a 'true' myeloma cell line.
Interestingly, contrary to the bortezomib resistance observed during the
clinical course, the THK-72 cells were sensitive to bortezomib in vitro.
As THK-72 arose from a classical myeloma, this oligosecretory myeloma
cell line will be useful for studies regarding the biological nature of
plasma cell neoplasms.

The cells were then screened with G418, and monoclonal cells were isolated
by the limited dilution method. Subclones were evaluated by karyotype
analysis, immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction, cell doubling time, and nude mice implantation. The established
immortalized eutopic stromal cell line was named hEM15A, and the ectopic

characteristics of endometrium stromal cells, and no abnormalities in
chromosome structure or number were observed. hEM5B2 cells exhibited the
characteristics of epithelial cells, but had a polyploid karyotype. Both
of these cell lines could be passaged continuously. No tumourigenicity was

Background: Cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) is a rare tumor entity and
the availability of systemic treatment is limited. Better knowledge of the
tumor physiology might lead to an improved treatment. However, basic
research is dependent on the availability of cell lines. As there are only
few CCC cell lines disposable, we aimed to isolate new CCC cell lines from
surgical samples.

Material and methods: The cell line was established from a 59-year-old
Caucasian male patient who suffered from malignant pleural effusion of a
distal cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC). The cell line was established by
explant culture and further characterized with immunohistochemistry and
Western blotting. Mutational analysis was performed by means of AmpliSeq
Cancer Panel v2. Additionally, we tested sensitivity towards commonly used
chemotherapeutics.

Results: Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed expression of
tumor markers typical for CCC cell lines. Analysis of sensitivity towards
chemotherapeutics revealed that Irinotecan was the only agent with
significant effect on cell proliferation. Mutational analysis identified
different mutations in important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

Conclusions: The new cell line displays the typical characteristics of a
CCC cell line. This new cell line might help to add new insights into this
tumor entity and thereby help to find better treatment options for
patients with CCC.

and characterization of genetic alterations relevant to the pathogenesis
of cervical cancer. A new cervical cancer cell line was established by
extensive culture and natural selection of cells a cervical cancer sample

The expression levels of p53 and k-ras were analyzed by immunocytochemical
staining, the mutations of p53 and k-ras were assessed by PCR-sequencing,
the sensitivity to cisplatin and taxol was measured by MTT assay,
chromosomal anomaly was detected by karyotyping. The newly established
cervical cancer cell line (CTCC-1) did not have detectable HPV DNA or HPV
viral particle. CTCC-1 cells had massive chromosomal changes and harbored
heterozygous mutations at 870 C>T (protein Pro223Leu) and 1022 G>T
(protein Val274Phe) of p53 gene (NM_000546) with reduced p53 expression
compared to C33A cells whereas k-ras was not mutated nor inhibited in CTCC-1
cells. CTCC-1 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin and taxol than Hela
but more resistant to taxol than C33A cells. Overexpressing wild type p53
significantly increased the sensitivity of CTCC-1 to those chemotherapy
agents. Mutant p53 might be responsible for the oncogenesis of some HPV-
negative cervical cancers.

Cell lines are a valuable biological tool for carrying out researches in
physiology, virology, pharmacology, toxicology, cancer/carcinogenesis and
transgenic fields. Several "fish cell lines" have been developed from a
broad range of tissues by explant techniques, e.g., ovary, fin, swim
bladder, heart, spleen, liver, eye muscle, vertebrae, brain, skin. At
present, 50 fish cell lines from 24 different fish species are maintained
and cryopreserved in the National Repository of fish cell line (NRFC),
NBFGR. In the current review, the authors have discussed the national
status and advances in the development cell lines from different fish
species. Besides these, the importance of cell line characterization,
applications and cross-contamination have also been discussed briefly in
this review. The author feels that this review article will undoubtedly
serve an updated database for the scientists/researchers in the field of
pathology, toxicology, fishery science, and other life science disciplines
wherever needed for research.

Transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder is one of the common
diseases that causes morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Malaysia,
bladder cancer is in the 10 most frequent cancer occurred among males.
Since most of the current urinary bladder cancer cell lines were
established from populations in western countries while significant
genotypic variations have been reported among various populations, this
project aimed at establishing the first continuous cell line for providing
an ideal cancer cell model for Malaysian population and nearby countries
acquires significance. The urinary bladder cancer cells were isolated from
bladder cancer tissues obtained from a Malay patient. The obtained cells
were cultured continuously over 30 passages. This cell line was
characterized by observing its morphology, growth characteristics,
presence of cytokeratin 7 and desmin markers, expression of Ki-67, VEGF as
well as p21 proteins. The authenticity of the obtained cells was
investigated using Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis and contamination by
Mycoplasma was ascertained. Results revealed that this newly established
cell line (USM-BC-1) has been well characterized as an ideal cancer cell
model which may prove useful in cancer research towards developing future
diagnostic and therapeutic targets, taking into consideration the
genotypic variations among Asian population.

By 'cell lines', an important biological tool can be obtained for carrying
out researches in physiology, virology, pharmacology, toxicology,
cancer/carcinogenesis and transgenic fields. Several fish cell lines
have been developed from a broad range of tissues, e.g., ovary, fin, swim
bladder, heart, spleen, liver, eye muscle, vertebrae, brain, skin. One
hundred and twenty-four new fish cell lines from different fish species
(ranging from grouper to eel) have been reported since 1994. Among the
cell lines reported, more than 60% were established from the fish species
of Asia, which contribute more than 80% of total fish production. These
are 59 cell lines from 19 freshwater, 54 from 22 marine and 11 from 3
brackish water fishes. By the year 2010, about 283 cell lines were
established from finfish allover the world. Besides these, the importance
of authentication, applications, cross-contamination and implications of

Purpose: lumen conjunctival epithelial cell lines were developed for use
in models of the human ocular surface for toxicological evaluations. The
purpose of this study was to characterize the properties of the new cell
lines.

Methods. Two human conjunctival cell lines, HC0597 and HC7.08, were
prepared by transfection of primary human conjunctival cells with the
large 'T' antigen plasmid p-RSV-T. Primary cells were isolated from human.
bulbar conjunctiva (S.E. Texas Lions Eye Bank). Both cell lines grow as
monoloyers on plastic, or stratified on permeable membranes in serum-free
KGM. The morphology of the conjunctival cells in low (0.15 mM) and high (1.
13 mM) calcium media was evaluated by light microscopy. Barrier function
in stratified cultures was evaluated by measuring transepethelial
electrical resistance (TER) and transepithelial permeability to Na
fluorescein (TEP). Keratins were identified by Western blotting.

Results: Both transfected human conjunctival cell lines demonstrated
cobblestone-like morphology typical of epithelial cells, and expressed
epithelial cytokeratins. Both cell lines have an extended life span. Cell
line HC0597 was cultured to passage #30 before growth slowed, and cell
line HC7.08 Is still growing at passage #30. Both conjunctival cell lines
undergo a change in morphology in high-calcium medium. The cells become
flattened, and cell-cell junctions become less distinct in high-calcium
KGM. Both cell lines stratify and form tight junctions when cultured on
permeable membranes. At day 10 of culture (3 days submerged and 7 days at
the air-liquid interface) HC0597 had a TER of 364+/-42 omega cm2 and
retained 98+/-1% of the fluorescein applied to the apical surface: HC7.08
had a TER of 217 +- 20 omega cm2 and retained 96 +- 1% fluorescein.

Conclusions: Conjunctival cell lines with an extended life span have been
produced. The transfected cell lines retained morphology and function that
are characteristic of human conjunctival epithelium. Since these cell
lines retained the ability to stratify and differentiate in culture, they
will be useful in developing in vitro models of the conjunctival surface.

Purpose: To establish long-term lines of non-transfected human lens
epithelial cells (HLECs). In all previous studies from numerous
laboratories, non-tnasfected HLECs complete at most 3.4 passages and
undergo senescence. The valuable information that has been discovered
using animal models needs to be validated on a human model system.

Methods: A novel method was developed wherein capsule-epithelial explants
were placed on microporous membranes in a 1:4 mixture of keratinocyte
growth medium and M199 over a 1:1:1 mixture of fetal bovine, rabbit and
horse sera. It was our rationale that the basal diffusion of 100% serum
through the membrane onto the explant would mimic a wound-healing
environment and possibly stimulate stem cell division.

Results: Cells were cultured for 4 passages (~5 months) over the 100%
serum mixture before growth became vigorous. After this time, the cells
showed continued growth even when transferred to conventional culture
dishes. The cells exhibit an epithelial morphology and are currently at
passage 20, population doubling level 50. One of the lines is primarily
diploid. The cells grow in response to insulin, IGF1 and ECGS. Cells form
colonies when plated at low density and can he cryopreserved and recovered.

Conclusions: Using a new and unique method to stimulate growth, we have
established two stable lines of HLECs. This technique may permit
establishment of cell lines from cataractous lenses.

Purpose: The objective of the current study was to construct,
characterize, and safety evaluate the CNTF secreting cell lines that will
be used for encapsulated cell therapy for treating retinal degenerative
diseases.

Methods: Two stable CNTF secreting human mammalian cell lines were
established by transfecting human RPE cells with a CNTF gene containing
plasmids. The CNTF secreting cell lines were designated NTC-201-10 and
NTC-201-6A. The growth characteristics, morphology and CNTF production were
monitored for over one year in culture. Their encapsulated performance was
evaluated both in vitro and in vivo: CNTF production was quantified by
ELISA, and bioactivity and specificity of CNTF were evaluated in a TF-1
CN5a.1 cell bioassay. Viral safety and tumorigenecity of the cell lines
were also examined.

Results: Both NTC-201-10 and NTC-201-6A cell lines maintained normal RPE
morphology with stable CNTF output in vitro for over a year. Un-
encapsulated NTC-201-10 cell line produced ~200 ng/106 cells/day, and
NTC-201-6A cell line produced ~800 ng/106 cells/day. Cell-secreted CNTF was
biologically active, with specific activity 2~3 fold higher than that
recombinant CNTF. Furthermore, the observed bioactivity was completely
blocked by a goat anti-CNTF neutralizing antibody. When encapsulated, both
cell lines secreted efficacious levels of CNTF in vivo, which was
quantified upon device explant at 1~5 ng/day for NTC-201-10 and 10~20
ng/day for NTC-201-6A, respectively. The cell lines tested negative for
viruses and are not tumorigenic in nude mice.

Conclusions: Two stable CNTF secreting cell lines were successfully
established which maintained normal growth characteristics and morphology
for over one year in vitro, and produced biologically active CNTF. Their
encapsulated performance and safety profile make them ideal for
encapsulated cell therapy.

Purpose: The CEV regimen, carboplatin (C), etoposide (E), and vincristine
(V), is commonly used for treating retinoblastoma (RB). Cyclosporin A
(CsA) has been added as an MDR-1 modulator to potentiate the clinical
activity of CEV. We tested these agents, and also melphalan (M) and
topotecan (T) on a panel of 10 RB cell lines in 20% and 2% O2.

Methods: The DIMSCAN cytotoxicity assay uses digital imaging microscopy
and fluorescein diacetate/eosin Y to quantify viable cells in microplates.
For pre-clinical testing of 2 to 4 anticancer drugs in various
combinations, we have developed a high-throughput (3-4 log dynamic range)
assay using 384-well microplates (DIMSCAN-384). 5/10 cell lines were
established from untreated patients (CHLA-192, 215, 222, 223, 224) and 5
from patients at relapse after chemotherapy (chemo) or radiotherapy (rad)
(CHLA-194, 203, 209, 210, 246). Cell lines with an LC higher than the
clinically achievable plasma concentration (C=3 mug/ml, E=5 mug/ml, V=0.5
mug/ml, M=10 mug/ml, T=0.1 mug/ml) were considered resistant; drug levels
in the eye, and especially in vitreous, are unknown.

Results: Resistance to single agents was seen in 30% (C), 30% (E), 20%
(V), 10% (M), 30% (T) of tested cell lines, with 6 of 10 cell lines
sensitive to all drugs (3 post-chemo, 1 post-rad), and 2 (1 pre-therapy, 1
post-rad) sensitive to only 1 (M or V). Median LC90 values were C=1.2
mug/ml, E=0.8 mug/ml, V=10 ng/ml, M=0.6 mug/ml, T=6.9 ng/ml. Using
DIMSCAN-384, we tested CEV+CsA, and M+T as single agents and in various
combinations in 5 RB cell lines. In 4 of 5 lines M+T did not achieve
synergistic cytotoxicity (P>0.2). CEV was no more active than single
agents in 4 of 5 lines (P>0.15). Single agent CsA was inactive in 5 of 5
tested cell lines (median LC=59 ug/ml). CsA enhanced (p<0.05) the
cytotoxicity of E (in 2 lines) and V (in 3 lines), but not C (in 4/5 lines;
P>0.05). CsA enhanced CEV cytotoxicity (p<0.05) in 3 of 5 cell lines,
achieving an additional 1-2 logs of cell kill over CEV alone. CsA also
enhanced the cytotoxicity of most 2 drug combinations (including those
with C), achieving 0.5-2 logs of additional cell kill over combinations
without CsA, and EV + CsA (in 5/5 lines), CV + CsA (4/5 lines) or CE +
CsA (3/5 lines) were as efective as CEV + CsA (P>0.05). Hypoxia (2% O2)
did not antagonize cytotoxicity of C, E, V, CsA, or any combination of
these agents (P>0.5).

Conclusions: These data suggest that CEV may not be more active than
single agents in many RB, and suggest that at drug levels achievable in
plasma, CsA can significantly enhance the activity of CEV against some RB.

DR   Cellosaurus; CVCL_B3PG; MS215
AB   Yes
Purpose: Uveal melanoma is the most frequent primary intraocular tumor in
the adult population. The metastatic ability of uveal melanoma is
particularly elevated as over 50% of the patients with this type of cancer
will also develop metastases to the liver. The exact molecular events
involved in the formation of the tumor and the metastatic progression of
uveal melanoma still remain unclear. The aim of this study was to
characterize a spontaneously generated cell line isolated from the uvea of
a normal donor with properties typical of aggressive uveal melanoma cell
lines.

Methods: The MS215 cell line has been isolated and cultured exactly as
performed for normal human uveal melanocytes. The phenotype of the MS215
cell line was observed at different passages by optical microscopy. FACS
analyses were performed to measure the expression of known markers of
uveal melanocytes and epithelial cells as well as several integrin
subunits. Their karyotype has been determined as well as their doubling
time.

Results: The MS215 cells have an epitheliod-like phenotype and could
sustain up to 18 passages without senescence which contrasts with the
fibroblast-like phenotype and the low number of passages (4-5) that normal
uveal melanocytes can sustain. However, MS215 cells express HMB-45, a well
known marker of uveal melanocytes. They also express cytokeratins 8/18
which is consistent with their epithelioid-like phenotype. In addition,
the doubling time of this cell line (20.5 h) is ~4-times faster than that
of normal uveal melanocytes (more than 78 h). Moreover, this cell line
shows a strong expression (as revealed by FACS analyses) and a high
promoter activity (as determined by transient transfections) of the alpha
4 integrin subunit whereas normal uveal melanocytes do not express this
integrin subunit.

Conclusions: The abnormal karyotype, the short doubling time, the
expression of the alpha 4 integrin subunit and the epitheloid-like
phenotype of these cell lines are typical of highly invasive uveal
melanoma cell lines rather than normal uveal melanocytes. Given that there
was no sign for the presence melanoma in the choroid of this normal donor,
it can be hypothesized that these cell lines originate from microtumors
that were present in the choroid of this patient.

AB   Yes
Purpose: Human embryonic stem (ES) cells offer significant opportunities
to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
normal tissue development and function. Similarly, disease-specific human
ES cells enable study of the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease
initiation and progression. We describe here the first human ES cells
(GENEA069) that contain the F305S BEST1 gene mutation associated with Best
vitelliform macular dystrophy (i.e., Best disease). While mutation of the
BEST1 protein is an underlying cause of Best disease little is known of
the mechanism of disease progression, which adds to our inability to treat
this disease. Investigating the differentiation and maintenance of retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) from both GENEA069 and normal human ES cells
offers a new approach to better understand, and potentially treat, Best
disease.

Methods: The GENEA069 cells were tested for features of human ES cells via
light microscopy, PCR, flow cytometry, and colony-forming cell ability.
Human ES cells were differentiated to RPE using a 3-stage in vitro method
that mimics aspects of embryonic RPE development: (i) generation of
ectodermal cells; (ii) generation of eye field, optic vesicle and RPE cell
types; and (iii) RPE purification via cloning rings. The progress of
differentiation was assessed using PCR for expression of genes involved in
RPE development (e.g., RAX, PAX6, MITF, RPE65, BEST1).

Results: Our data shows GENEA069 cells have characteristic features of
human ES cells, including: (i) typical morphology; (ii) expression of
OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and FOXD3; (iii) expression of high levels of TRA-1-60,
TRA-1-81, and OCT4 antigens (>90% of cells); and (iv) an ability to give
rise to alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies. Differentiation of both
GENEA069 and normal human ES cells resulted in successive patterns of gene
expression characteristic of embryonic RPE development, ultimately
producing pigmented cells with typical RPE morphology that express
transcripts for RPE65 and BEST1.

Conclusions: These data suggest that GENEA069 cells are morphologically
indistinguishable from other human ES cell lines, and that they express
key molecular components required for pluripotency. Moreover, GENEA069
cells can be differentiated to produce mature, pigmented RPE that
expresses BEST1. The RPE generated from both GENEA069 and normal human ES
cells offers exciting new avenues for investigating the molecular
mechanisms responsible for normal and pathological RPE development,
maintenance, and function. The data obtained from these studies may aid in
the development of new or improved therapies for RPE-based blinding
disorders, in particular, Best disease.

By immunizing mice with killed whole bacterial cells of Brucella abortus S
(99), a panel of six hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
specific for the surface antigens of this bacterium were produced. ELISA
was used to screen the hybridoma supernatants. Immunoblots of the cell
extract indicated that three mAb were specific for S-LPS (Ba-1, Ba-2, Ba-3)
and three others were reactive with major outer membrane proteins (OMP)
(Ba-4, Ba-5, Ba-6). The OMP recognized by these antibodies were the
proteins with molecular masses of 25-27 kDa (Ba-4, Ba-5) and 36-38 kDa
(Ba-6). None of the four mAb including Ba-3, Ba-4, Ba-5 and Ba-6 cross
reacted with any other bacteria close to Brucella abortus, but Ba-1 and Ba-2
cross reacted with B. melitensis 16M and B. suis. By using cell extract and
killed whole cell Ag in ELISA, it was indicated that all mAb except Ba-6
have better reactivity with cell extract Ag, but Ba-6 mAb reacted with

Human diploid fibroblast cells produce a spectrum of necessary growth
factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components essential for growth and
proliferation of a variety of other cell types. In this study, the effect
of five human embryonic fibroblast cell lines, isolated from liver, lung,
skin and foreskin tissues, was investigated. A coculture system analyse
was employed to cloning efficiency (CE) and DNA synthesis of a human
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) in
long-and short-term cultures. The fibroblast cells were used as feeder
layer after treatment with mitomycin C. Optimal density of the feeder
cells induced 10 to 43 times higher CE than cultures supplemented with
conditioned media (CM) or cultures without a feeder layer. The stimulatory
effect of the feeder cells was partly associated to their tissue origin,
with the lung and liver fibroblasts being the most and least effective
feeder cells, respectively. Short-term cultures of LCL cells with feeder
cells or their CM resulted in a marginal increase in DNA synthesis and
proliferation as evidenced by the index of 3H-thymidine incorporation. Our
results demonstrated supportive effects of feeder cells on the LCL growth,
which can not be replaced by their CM. These supportive effects were
partly associated with cell density and tissue origin of the feeder cells.

Background: Production of monoclonal antibodies to Leishmania antigens
assists the identification and characterization of these organisms.
Objective: Production of monoclonal antibodies against epitopes on the
gp63.

Methods: Two murine monoclonal antibodies to gp63 were produced and
characterized. The reactions of both antibodies with soluble leishmanial
antigens, purified gp63 and truncated recombinant gp63 molecules were
studied by an ELISA assay. These two antibodies reacted with the crude
soluble antigens prepared from 4 reference strains of Leishmania, 10
isolates from the patients, purified gp63 and recombinant gp63 molecules.
However, no reaction with several non-leishmanial antigens was observed.
Reaction of both antibodies with the intact recombinant gp63 and truncated
molecules were compared.

Results: The results indicated that the two antibodies specifically
recognize two different epitopes on the gp63 molecule.

Conclusions: Possible applications of such antibodies in searching for
immunogenic epitopes are discussed.

Background: Monoclonal antibody technology allows identification of
amastigote-specific antigen in human tissue biopsies and search for a
suitable vaccine candidate, which may induce a long lasting immunity.
Objectives: Production and partial characterization of seven monoclonal
antibodies against Leishmania tropica promastigotes.

Methods: Seven murine monoclonal antibodies of the IgG isotype were
produced against the stationary stage promastigotes of Leishmania tropica.

Results: Extensive cross reactivity was found within 4 reference strains
and isolates from the patients. Non-Leishmanial antigens were not
recognized by any of the antibodies. One antibody recognized a diffuse
band 64 to 86 kDa, and the other 6 recognized 1, 2, or more bands in
immunoblotting of soluble antigens of promastigotes. The reaction of these
7 antibodies with the soluble extracts of 4 reference strains of
Leishmania and 10 isolates from patients was studied.

Conclusions: Although these antibodies were not suitable for identification
purposes, the characterization of shared epitopes may be considered in
studying the antigenic structure of these organisms. Further experiments
may confirm the idea that some of these epitopes are suitable vaccine
candidates.

Fc gamma receptor 3B (FcgammaRIIIB, encoded by the gene FCGR3B) plays a
crucial role in immunity response activated by cellular effectors and
regulatory functions. Copy number variation (CNV) of this gene has been
previously reported to affect susceptibility to several diseases such as
autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory response. One of the rarest
and smallest tribes of Orang Asli which is Negrito-Mendriq sample was used
as a subject in this study. Twenty-two (22) lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs) of Negrito-Mendriq was obtained from the deposited cell archive,
Institute Medical Molecular Biotechnology, IMMB (UiTM Sg Buloh, Selangor,
Malaysia) and the LCLs were revived. The DNA was extracted from the LCL
and finally PRT - REDVR assay was carried for FCGR3B copy number
genotyping. Analysis revealed that copy number 2 demonstrated the highest
distribution for FCGR3B (90.9%); whilst no copy number loss was found for
FCGR3B. For high copy number (>2), 9.1% was obtained. Copy number greater
than 3 (>3) was not found in this study. Finally, it was concluded that no
significant difference of CNV of FCGR3B for Orang Asli Negrito-Mendriq
when compared with the reported studies. CNV of FCGR3B genes of Negrito-
Mendriq was found normal in this study, where the pattern of copy number
distribution was almost similar with previously reported studies.

AB   Yes
Background: Most cell lines derived from primary effusion lymphomas (PEL)
are both HHV-8+ and EBV+. A new cell line (ISI-1) which is only HHV-8+ was
established from the lymphomatous pleural effusion of a HIV-infected
patient.

Cell line characteristics: The morphology and phenotype of the original
lymphomatous cells as well as of the cells in culture were characteristic
of PEL: large/anaplastic cells, CD2-, CD3-, CD19-, CD20-, CD38+, CD71+,
CD45+, CD30+, MHC class I +, class II -. A clonal rearrangement of IgH
gene was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. The cytogenetic study
revealed multiple chromosome abnormalities. Presence of HHV-8 and absence
of EBV DNA sequences were demonstrated using PCR and Southern blot
analysis. These characteristics have remained stable after 20 months.

Cytokines production: The cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640 and FCS
(15%) and the spontaneous cytokines production was evaluated in the
culture supernatant using ELISA assays. Large amounts of IL10 (26218 pg/ml
[106 cells]) and low concentrations of IL6 (49 pg/ml [106 cells]) were
detected. Intracytoplasmic IL10 production and the expression of the IL10
receptor were demonstrated using flow cytometry.

Animal model: 5x10^6 cells were infused intra peritoneously in 6 NOD/SCID
mice. All mice developed lymphomatous ascitis between day 27 and 96. Nodal
and splenic involvement were present in 3/3. New cell lines (ISI-11, ISI-12)
could be established from the ascitis and spleen of two mice and
exhibited the same phenotype and clonal IgH gene rearrangement than ISI-1.
At day 14 ex vivo, ISI-11 produces IL10 (3179 pg/ml [106 cells]) and no
detectable IL6.

Conclusions: A new HHV-8+ EBV -B cell line (ISI-1) produces large amounts
of IL10 and induces tumors in NOD/SCID mice.

AB   Yes
To facilitate investigation of Ca2+ and Na+ transport by parathyroid
hormone (PTH)-sensitive distal convoluted tubules (DCT), we established a
stable line of these cells. Hybrid primary cultures consisting of DCT and
cortical ascending limb cells were isolated from mice by immunodissection.
Cells were infected with chimeric adenovirus 12-Simian virus 40 and grown
in DMEM/Ham's F-12 media until mock infectants had expired. Cells were
then passaged and cloned by limiting dilution. We measured ouabain (OUA)-
suppressible oxygen consumption (QO2, nmol O2 consumed x min^-1 x mg prot^-1)
in clones exhibiting PTH-stimulated cAMP formation >= 5x control. As
shown in the table, in the mouse DCT (MDCT) cell line designated 210B3,
chlorothiazide (CTZ) and amiloride (AMIL) significantly inhibited Q02
(P<0.05); bumetanide (BUM) had no significant effect (either alone or
when added to CTZ). Further characterization of these cells was
accomplished by measuring 22Na+ and of 36Cl- uptake at an external NaCl
concentration of 140 mM. CTZ significantly decreased 22Na+ and 36Cl- uptake
by 36 +- 3% and 52 +- 4%, respectively (P<0.05). BUM had no effect. AMIL
decreased 22Na+ uptake by 40 +-4% (P<0.05), but had no effect on 36Cl-
uptake. CTZ and AMIL increased 45Ca2+ uptake by 37 +- 3% and 28 + 2% (P<0.05),
respectively, while BUM had no effect. Activation of adenylyl cyclase
by PTH, inhibition of Na+ and Cl- transport and stimulation of Ca2+
transport by thiazide diuretics, together with the lack of effect of BUM
is consistent with a DCT phenotype. In summary, the results demonstrate
the development of a cell line, MDCT 210B3, that is PTH sensitive,
expresses thiazide inhibitable Na-Cl cotransport, AMIL-sensitive Na+
uptake, and thiazide- and AMIL-stimulated Ca2+ uptake.

A cell line of monocytic origin named HL-CZ has been established in long-

The cell size in this culture is mostly 16 mum (with a range of 12-30 mum)
in diameter. The doubling time of the cell is 22-26 hrs. The light
microscopy and electron microscopy of the cells show that these monocytic
cells are phagocytic, with single, double or multiple nuclei. Abundant
basophilic cytoplasm is one of the characteristics of the cells. Since
more than 90% of the cells possess CD 15 marker and show early
differentiation in hematopoiesis, it is designated as a population of
promonocyte, The chromosome number of each cell varies from 41 to 75 with
fragment aberration in 91% and the other with isochromatin break and gap.
Some detailed analysis of the cell markers and complicated chromosome
pictures remain for further studies.

Some special properties of a human promonocyte cell line, HL-CZ, were
characterized after long-term cloning and subcloning in vitro. About 90%
of the cells was detected with CD34-like marker, and 37% of them shown
CD11b positive. Meanwhile, 17% of them had phagocytosis activity when
evaluated by flow cytometry. It was also found that 30-69.3% of the cells
were interleukin 6 positive, 17.8-19.3% and 28-73% were interleukin 1-beta
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) positive, respectively, when
detected by indirect immunofluorecence. In the cytochemical studies, none
of them had peroxidase or nonspecific esterase activities, whereas
granular type of periodic acid Schiff reaction was seen in small
population of the cells. An interesting phenomenon was that the
heterogeneity was found in every subclone of long-term culture. Some huge
cells were always present after 2-3 days of culture. When co-cultured with
hepatitis C patient serum, the percentage of huge cells increased and an

viability rate of 96.2%, displayed a typical 'S' shaped growth curve with
a population doubling time of 25 hours, and were free from microbial,
fungal and mycoplasma contamination. We further characterized these cell
lines and, in this communication we show the cytogenetic analysis and the
genetic transfection of GSF289 cells. The GSF289 cell line which
originated from Saanen breed of goats was successfully transfected with
pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP plasmid vector containing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
gene under human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The efficiency of
transfection, as measured by flow cytometry, was 14.5% after 4 days of
culture. The cytogenetic analysis performed on 29 G-banded metaphase cells
revealed that the cell line has a normal male goat karyotype consisting of
58 autosomes and two XY sex chromosomes. These results suggest that GSF289
cell line with a normal karyotype, having a high rate of proliferation,
and its ability to be easily transfected with plasmid DNA vectors is an
additional tool to study molecular mechanisms that regulate fibroblast
function as well as genetic manipulation of small ruminants.

multiple protrusions. Cells of the lines UKF-NB-1 and 3 grew also in
aggregates but did not form any protrusions. Clonal culture both of the
SK-N-SH and UKF-NB-2 cells in semisolid medium revealed unipolar character
of the protrusions, in which neurofilaments were found by employing
monoclonal antibodies. Clonal cultures both of the UKF-NB-1 and 3 cell
lines revealed sharply delineated cells. It is proposed that the lines
SK-N-SH and UKF-NB-2 arrested their differentiation at the stage of unipolar
neuroblasts and that the lines UKF-NB-1 and 3 arrested their
differentiation at the stage of apolar neuroblasts. Demonstration of a

doxorubicin from the human squamous lung cancer cell line SW-1573 in order
to study the expression of P-glycoprotcin during subsequent stages of
resis-tance development. Up to SW-1573/2R120 the cell lines exhibited low
levels of cross-resistance to vincristine, and gramicidin D, but
relatively high levels of cross-resistance to etoposide. Cellular
accumulation of daunorubicin and vincristine was markedly decreased in all
sublines and a small modulation of resistance levels and drug accumulation
by verapamil could be detected. However, no P-glycoprotein could be
detected by Western blotting using C219 and no overexpression of the indr1
gene occurred in these sublines. Cell lines SW-1573/2R160 and SW-1573/2R250
display a large increase in doxorubicin resistance levels coinciding with a
large overexpression of P-glycoprotein (about 3.5 x 10E5 molecules/cell) as
calculated from binding experiments with 125I-labeled MRK-16. These findings
indicate that early steps of pleiotropic resistance to anticancer drugs,
induced by doxorubicin selection, can be mediated by other mechanisms than a
gradual increase in P-glycoprotein expression. This mechanism gives a
relatively high etoposide resistance. As a consequence, low level, drug
transport-dependent resistance might be missed by detection methods using
mdr-1 specific reagents.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (cylindroma) and pleomorphic adenoma are
neoplasms derived from the intercalar duct of salivary glands. We studied
differentiation patterns of adenoid cystic carcinoma and pleomorphic
adenoma, by comparing cell cultures from these two neoplasms. The first
differentiation parameter assessed was the presence of cytoskeletal
proteins. Immunofluorescence showed that pleomorphic adenoma cells (AP2)
showed only vimentin, while cylindroma cells (CAC2) expressed vimentin,
muscle-specific actin and the cytokeratins 8, 14, 18 and 19. This
preliminary result suggested that CAC2 cells would be more differentiated
than AP2 cells. To further investigate this result, and by knowing that
basement membrane proteins induce citodifferentiation, we cultured both
cell lines on the top of a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel). In
these conditions, AP2 cells were not able to differentiate into ductiform
structures, while CAC2 cells morpho and cytodifferentiated into authentic
ductiform structures, as demonstrated by fluorescence confocal microscopy.
Knowing that AP2 cells originate ductiform structures only when grown
inside a three-dimensional environment of Matrigel, we may infer that CAC2
need a less complex induction to form the same structure, Thus, we suggest
that cylindroma cells are derived from intercalar duct cells in a more
advanced stage of differentiation than the cells that originate
pleomorphic adenoma.

characteristics of this cell line are described briefly. The conditions
used in primary cell culture and subculture are TC-199 medium containing a
moderate amount of antibiotics and 20% calf serum and incubated at
temperature 27-28 Celsius, pH 7.2. A heteroploid cell line has been
established through 100 subculture passage over a period of 24 months. The
cell line consists of epithelial like cells in a great measure and a few
fibroblast like cells. The optimum growth conditions of CAB-80 is at
temperature 22-28 Celsius and pH value range at 7.2-8.2. The time for
doubling CAB-80 cell population requires 21-45 hours. After incubation for
24 hours, the mitotic index of CAB-80 is 29.5% The distribution of
chromosome numbers of 60th passage cells are ranged from 68 to 178, so it
is heteroploid cell line. The experiment shows that the CAB-80 cells have
somewhat cytopathogenic effect to reovirus infection. It may be used as a

calf serum containing a moderate amount of antibiotics. The morphology of
GCCF-2 cells is a complex of epithelial-like cells, fibroblastic-like
cells and the medial type cells. The cells can increase five times in five
days and the highest mitotic index of GCCF-2 is 30.04% in two dayse after
plating. An interesting discovery was observed that the cells which had
been kept in the incubator at 20 Celsius for two months without any care
could grow normally after subculture. At the 90th passage, the cells which
had a normal number of chromosomes of grass carp (2n=48) accounted for 86.7%,
so the line was determined as a diploid fish cell line. So far, the
line hes been maintained in proliferating for over 32 months. Using the
technique of BrdU-labeling and sister chromatid differential staining, we
estimate the cell cycle time of mitotie division of GCCF-2 is between 21-33

We studied the molecular defects in the XPC gene in a 47 y old woman with
XP (XP86BE) with severe sun sensitivity and multiple cutaneous neoplasms.
UV cell killing was 3 times normal in XP86BE skin fibroblasts. Host cell
reactivation of a UV-treated reporter plasmid cotransfected with a vector
expressing wild type XPC message assigned XP86BE to XP complementation
group C. RT-PCR of total RNA revealed two alternatively spliced XPC mRNA
isoforms in the exon 2 region: (I) a deletion of 68 bases at the 3' end of
exon 2 and (II) a 141 base insertion between exons 2 and 3 that retains
the 5' end of intron 2. These changes resulted in frameshifts with new
termination sites that would encode truncated XPC proteins. Genomic DNA
analysis showed a homozygous G to A mutation at the splice donor site of
XPC intron 2. This mutation reduces the information content of splice
donor 2 from 10.2 to +- 2.6 bits and results in use of cryptic donor sites
of 8.6 bits (isoform I) and 9.5 bits (isoform II). The mutation
inactivates a Bsu36 I site in intron 2 that can be used to diagnose the
genomic status of other family members. The splice donor site mutation
identified in XP86BE cells resulted in alternatively spliced XPC mRNA
isoforms which utilize cryptic donors with high information content and
are predicted to encode truncated XPC proteins with defective DNA repair
function resulting in clinical disease.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disease
characterized by sun sensitivity and a high incidence of skin cancer in
association with defective nucleotide excision repair (NER). XP patient
(XP202DC) had progressive neurodegeneration with dementia, severe
generalized brain atrophy beginning at age 15 years, and death by 37 years.
The ERCC1 gene in her cells had heterozygous mutations: one nonsense
mutation (K226X) and one splice mutation (IVS6-26G>A). The delayed onset
and severe neurological degeneration with generalized brain atrophy were
very different from other XP patients but very similar to three XP
patients in 2 new families (XP48DC and siblings CO14TA and CO107TA) who
were heterozygous for a missense mutation (R788W) in the XPF gene. XPF and
ERCC1 form a heterodimer that functions as a 5'endonuclease in a late
stage of the NER reaction. XPF and ERCC1 interact in the region that is
disrupted by the mutations found in our patients. The similarity of the
neurologic abnormalities among the patients with ERCC1 and XP-F defects
suggests that dysfunction of the XPF/ERCC1 complex causes this unusual
form of severe neurological degeneration. These findings describe an
important new role of NER proteins in maintaining the integrity of the
central nervous system.

The lariat-loop formation involving branch point sequence (BPS) near the
3'end of introns is crucial for precise processing of the pre-mRNA. We
previously reported that mutations within -4 and -24 branch point
sequences (BPS) in intron3 of the XPC gene differentially affects the XPC
premRNA splicing by disrupting lariat-loop formation in xeroderma
pigmentosum (XP) patients (Hum. Mol. Genetics, 13: 343 (2004)). Here we
studied two related XP patients, XP14BE and XP377BE, with multiple skin
cancers and reduced DNA repair. Their cells had the same 9 base-pair
deletion (-13 to -21) that lies 3 bases downstream of the -25 'A' of the
mapped BPS in intron6 of the XPC gene. This deletion mutation moved the
BPS closer to intron6/exon7 junction and abolished lariat-loop formation.
This change reduced the information content of the intron6 splice acceptor
from 12.3 to 6.2 bits. These cells exclusively expressed XPC mRNA with an
in-frame exon7 deletion. The cells had reduced amounts of mutant XPC
protein. This mutation abolished DNA repair activity since an expression
vector containing XPC cDNA devoid of exon 7 failed to correct DNA repair
defect in other XP-C cells in a post-UV host cell reactivation assay. The
mutant XPC protein did not localize to UV-induced DNA-lesions in the
patient's cells. Thus, the 30 amino acid sequence derived from exon 7 of
the XPC gene is an important motif for localization of XPC protein to the
site of damaged-DNA. Abolishing lariat-loop formation resulted in
expression of mutant XPC protein with reduced nucleotide excision repair
function that resulted in multiple sunlight-induced skin cancers in these
XP-C patients.

cultured cell lines were transplantable into nude mice, and the pathologic
features of the transplants were similar to those of the original tumors.
Furthermore, KOC-4c was intraperitoneally transplantable to exhibit a
picture of peritoneal carcinomatosis, suggesting a feasible experimental
model for human ovarian cancer. There was remarkable difference between the
population doubling times of KOC-5c and KOC-7c, showing 97.9 hours for the
former and 45.9 hours for the latter. A more anaplastic histologic feature
of KOC-7c, mainly comprising hobnail cell patterns, might contribute the
difference of doubling time. Tumor markers, CA125 and SLX, were detectable
in the culture medium of KOC-5c cell line, as well as the serum of the
patient with original cancer. Although the original tumors were negatively
stained with mutant p53 protein, the gene protein was found in both KOC-5c

properties in vitro, ability to produce viruses, the characteristics of

and following results were obtained. 1) The chromosome number and
population-doubling time were 80 and 18 hours respectively in all cell
lines except DD-764. 2) The virus produced by these cell lines was
considered to be B-type RNA virus (MuMTV) according to the following
evidence: a) the culture harvest contained virus particles with a density
of 1.17g/ml, and 70S RNA was extracted from the particles, b) the viral
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) prefers rather Mg" than Mn" with poly
(rA).(dT)12-14 as synthetic template-primer, c) no murine leukemia virus
(MuLV) was detected by the UV-XC test and Mink S+L- focus induction assay.
3) The kinetics of virus release into culture fluid was studied by RDDP
assay. MuMTV production was not observed in the epithelial cell lines at
the logarithmic phase of cell growth, but was observed at the stationary
phase. 4) The levels of MuMTV production in 4 different cell lines were
compared by RDDP assays. DD-762 produced approximately 0.8mg viral
protein/l/day and is considered an excellent source of MuMTV. 5) DXM
(5mug/ml) resulted in about a 15-fold increase in MuMTV production in the
presence of insulin (10/mug/ml). This enhancing effect was reversible.

AB   Yes
Current therapy of ovarian cancer consists of primary surgical debulking
followed by chemotherapy. Drug selection in chemotherapy usually is not
based on individualized in vitro sensitivity studies but on reported
response rates of previous clinical trials. To understand the in vitro
cytotoxicity effect of drugs, a newly established ovarian cancer cell line
is used for this study. This cell line, OCPC-2-VGH, is isolated from an
ovarian papillary serous adenocarcinoma in 1991. The doubling time of
cells ranges from 44.85 to 58.98 hours in different conditional culture
medium with different percentage of fetal calf serum. Their chromosome
numbers ranged from 38 to 52 with a modal number of diploidy 46.
Immunohistochemical studies of OCPC-2-VGH cells for cytoskeleton, desmin,
fibronectin, myoglobin and vimentin are all positive, but epithelial
membrane antibody is not. The cytotoxic effects of six chemotherapeutic
drugs studied in vitro of OCPC-2-VGH cells are different. Some tumor cells
show almost complete cell kill at the low drug level; but others have only
a limited response at the high concentration. For OCPC-2 cells, the fifty
percent lethal dose of bleomycin is 15.1mug/ml; epirubcin 30.7mug/ml;
vincristine 123.4mug/ml; cis-platinum 310.9mug/ml; ifosphamide 564.6mug/ml;
and cyclophosphamide 4110.2mug/ml. The results demonstrate that the
proposed studies are capable of estimating an assay for the drug response
in individual ovarian cancer and thus may contribute to reducing of chemo-
resistance in clinical selection of ovarian cancer patients.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in cervids
and a member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also
known as prion diseases. We previously generated a persistently CWD prion
infected RK13 cell line (RKC1-11) using elk PrPC expressing cells
(elkRK13) that were generated with the lentiviral expression system. To
investigate the differentially expressed (DE) genes involved in prion
infection at the cellular level, we performed microarray analysis and
identified the DE genes between CWD-infected (RKC1-11) and non-infected
cells (elkRK13). Collectively, 88 genes were found to be differentially
expressed (42 genes upregulated > 2-fold; 46 genes downregulated <0.5-fold);
additionally, 10 up- and 8 downregulated genes agreed with the
results of the qRT-PCR. Among these genes, we chose 8 DE genes associated
with cell growth, signal transduction, transport, immune response and
apoptosis based on gene function analysis for further analysis. The
expression of the selected genes was further validated using an animal
model in normal-and CWD-infected TgElk mice showing clinical signs at 185
dpi. These identified DE genes in both the in vitro and in vivo model
could help in understanding the diagnosis and pathogenesis of prion
diseases.

Cowdria ruminantium is an intracellular organism parasitising the vascular
endothelial cells of ruminants. Recently, the organism has been
successfully cultured in endothelial cells of bovine umbilical cord or
other bovine vascular origin. In an ongoing study to identify more
suitable cell lines for the cultivation of the organism, an ovine cerebral
vascular endothelial cell (SBE189) was isolated and tested for its ability
to support the growth of infective C. ruminantium organisms in vitro. A
study of the developmental cycle of the organism was done on the SBE189
and E5 (a bovine umbilical cord cell line). Twenty-four hour samples were
taken post-infection (p.i.) of cultures. Electron microscopical studies of
the 24 h sample showed cells with 2 or 3 membrane-bound organisms. One of
the organisms was usually large, pleomorphic and reticulate, whereas the
smaller ones had a markedly denser matrix. In the 48 h sample, cells
contained larger colonies with a condensed matrix. In the 72 h sample,
colonies had almost doubled in size and had retained the same density as
the 48 h sample with a few of the organisms within the colonies containing
a lesser dense matrix. The 96 h sample showed a mixed population of
organisms, from pleomorphic reticulated forms to round reticulated forms
containing dark blotches of condensed matrix. The few organisms found in
the vacuole of the 120 h sample, were either dense pleomorphic forms or
what appeared to be degenerative pleomorphic forms with a dense outer
matrix surrounding a vacuole. The C. ruminantium in the SBE189 cells was
allowed to infect almost 100% of the cells by placing the flask on a slow
horizontal rocker. Eight days p.i. the culture material was injected
intravenously into mice, resulting in a 100% mortality within 10 d. The
lung smears of mice, killed in extremis, proved to contain single
organisms or colonies of C. ruminantium. The cell line was found to be
highly suitable for the growth of C. ruminantium and has been added to the
stock of endothelial cells currently in use for the maintenance of
C.ruminantium in vitro.

that high times dilution cell still have the normal proliferating ability;
GFF can be cultured in H-MEM-5; after defrosting, GFF still maintained
high proliferating ability and the cell survival rate is 85%. At the same

AB   Yes
Objective: To establish a carboplatin (CBP)-resistant tongue squamous
carcinoma cell line, Tca8113/CBP cells, and to observe the reversal effect
of neferine in these cells.

Methods: Tca8113/CBP cell line was established by gradually increasing the
concentration of carboplatin and intermittent inducement to Tca8113 cells.
Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to evaluate the reversal
effect of neferine on proliferation in Tca8113/CBP cells. mRNA expression
of drug-resistance-associated genes, lung related resistant protein
(LRP) and fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin (FMT) were monitored by RT-PCR
in the cells before and after resistance establishment. Morphology of the
cells was observed under fluorescent microscopy, and the intracellular
changes of cytoskeleton between reversed Tca8113/CBP and non-reversed
Tca8113/CBP were compared.

Results: After 5 month's CBP treatment, Tca8113/CBP cells which can be
stably resistant to carboplatin (16 mug/ml) was successfully established.
The resistance index is 4.06. Neferine reversed the resistance of
Tca8113/CBP cells with a reversal fold of 2.12. Compared to the Tca8113
cells, the expression of LRP and FMT at mRNA level was increased obviously
in Tca8113/CBP cells. Whereas they were decreased after neferine treatment
(p<0.01), and the intracellular F-actin content was also decreased,
arranged in neat rows, more evenly distributed close to the level of
non-resistant Tca8113 cells.

Conclusions: Neferine exhibits the reversal effect on Tca8113/CBP cells,
which may be relate to decrease of LRP and FMT expression, increase of
intracellular content of carboplatin, change of the microfilament, reduce
of mechanical properties of adhesion, and interference of cell cycle in
Tca8113/CBP cells.

AB   Yes
A relationship between the membrane potential and the secretion of
glucagon was studied using a glucagon-producing tumor cell line, ITC-1,
which was established by Sugimoto et al. The membrane potential was
monitored by the potential-sensitive dye, NK-2453. Fluorescence at 505 nm
emission with excitation wave length at 460 nm was increased by changing
the potassium concentration from 5.7 to 10, 20, 40 or 60 mM, thereby
suggesting that ITC-1 cells depolarized in high-K+ Hanks solutions. An
increase in glucagon release was noticeable only when the external
potassium concentration exceeded 40 mM. In the concentration range under
20 mM, the amount of glucagon released was in the same range as that of
spontaneously released glucagon in normal Hanks solution. These results
suggest that there are two mechanisms of the glucagon secretion in ITC-1
cells. One is critically regulated by the membrane potential. The other is
responsible for the spontaneous secretion of glucagon, independently of
the membrane potential.

A new cell line TY-ES was established from Ewing's sarcoma derived from a

cell line was found to be oncogenic in severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) mice. When incubated in a standard culture dish, this cell line
(TY-ES) grew in suspension, but in the presence of type I collagen and
gelatin, the cells grew and adhered to the dish wall. The doubling time of
the cells was 40 hours. When stained immunohistochemically, TY-ES cells
reacted positively with antibody to MIC2 (Ewing's sarcoma specific
antibody) and antibody to vimentin. They also showed partially positive
reactions to the stains for NFP and NSE. It was previously reported that
treatment with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) induced
neural differentiation of Ewing's sarcoma cells. In the present study, we
examined the effects of db-cAMP treatment on the characteristics of TY-ES
and three other Ewing's sarcoma cell lines (SCCH-196, RD-ES and SK-ES).
The growth of all 4 cell lines was suppressed by db-cAMP treatment in a
dose-dependent manner. Tumor formation following transplantation of
db-cAMP-treated TY-ES or RD-ES cells into SCID mice was also significantly
suppressed. The growth of db-cAMP treated SK-ES or SCCH-196 cells in these
mice did not show significant suppression. Chemoinvasion, examined as an

Cell culture of insects is one of the most important techniques for the
basic research of life science and biotechnology. Since Grace first
established the insect continuous cell line, one fourth century has passed.
During this period, many culture media were developed and more than 51
cell lines of Lepidoptera were established; thus the cell culture became a
mature technique in the field of establishment of continuous cell lines.
The application of insect cell culture is expected for the virus
production in vitro aiming at the pest control, and for the production of
useful proteins by the Baculovirus cell line system. For the economic
production of viruses or useful proteins, several problems, such as 1)
establishment of highly proliferative cell line, 2) selection of cell
highly susceptible to viruses, 3) development of low-cost medium, and 4)
large-scale culture of cells, must be solved. In the present paper, I
report the establishment of continuous cell lines of the silkworm, Bombyx
mori, and its usefulness for the research on the relationship between the
multiplication of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus and the culture
condition of cells. In addition, the cell line of the cabbage armyworm,

Histochemically, cultured cells revealed positive catecholamine
fluorescense and monoamine oxidase activity. It is concluded that this
line is derived from malignant sympathetic neurons.

with 10% fetal bovine serum alone, and the population doubling time was
6.93 days. Spherical cells were predominant but sometimes odd-shaped cells
appeared, Karyotype of the cell line was typical of lepidopteran cell
lines and consisted of numerous small chromosomes. The cell line could be
discriminated from other lepidopteran cell lines by comparing the patterns
of isozymes of several enzymes. M. neustria testacea nuclear polyhedrosis

Baculoviruses have a significant potential as biological pesticides.
Spodoptera littoralis multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpliMNPV) could
thus find an application to protect plants against the African Cotton
Leafworm. For the in vitro production of SpliMNPV a cellular system has to
be established. For this purpose three new continuous cell lines were
established from the embryonic tissue of the cotton leaf worm S.
littoralis.The three cell lines were designated Spli-C, Spli-S and Spli-B.
They consisted mostly of spherical cells, but also contained spindle and
giant cells. The population doubling time for the three cell lines Spli-C,
Spli-S and Spli-B were 30.5, 31 and 44.5 hrs, respectively, at passage 19,
while at passage 120 it decreased to 26, 27 and 32 hrs, respectively. RAPD
and DAF DNA fingerprint confirmed that the cell lines originated from S.
littoralis tissues. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme analysis
demonstrated a distinguishable difference between the three new S.
littoralis cell lines and the other insect cell lines which we use in our
laboratory. All three new cell lines were susceptible to SpliMNPV and thus
are suitable for virus multipication. Cells were immobilized using sodium
cellulose sulfate (NaCS) and poly diallyl dimethyl ammoniumchloride
(PDADMAC) capsules to protect cells from shear stress. This is caused
during cultivation by agitation and gas sparging during supply of
sufficient oxygen in order to reach high cell densities. The cell
densities increased from 4-5x10^6 cells/ml in suspension culture to
1.3x10^7 cells/ml in capsules. Our results suggest that large-scale
production of SpliMNPV as a biopesticide is possible with these cell lines.

1. An egg-mass of tortricids at the black-headed stage was sterilized by
dipping in 70% ethanol for 1 minute and subsequently in a 0.1% aqueous
solution of mercury chloride for 20 minutes, and then rinsed with sterile
distilled water and wiped with filter paper under aseptic conditions.
Thereafter, the egg-mass was put into a screw-capped test tube containing
0.5ml of medium. The tube was inclined with light reaching the bottom part.
After 2 or 3 days incubation at 25 Celsius, the hatched larvae were
transferred together with the medium into a watch glass, and cut under
aseptic conditions. The explants thus obtained were transferred into
plastic culture flasks (Falcon 3013) together with 4ml of IPL41S medium
and incubated.

2. Most of the explants underwent degenerative changes with melanization
and collapsed, but the remains survived for several months. From these
materials, free cells and/or hollow vesicles were obtained after several
changes of the medium at 10 to 20 day intervals using one-half of fresh
medium until the cells entered the proliferative stage and almost all the
bottom surface of the culture flask was covered by cells. After a long
initial period of adaptation which ranged from 161 to 346 days depending
on the tortricid species used, 8 cell lines were eventually established.

3. The cell lines were maintained by the addition of one-half of fresh
medium until the 5th to 7th subcultures. Thereafter, the ratio of cell
suspension and fresh medium was shifted to 1:4 to 1:9, as the number of
cells increased in each cell line, at weekly intervals.

4. All of the serum used were evaluated based on the growth curves using
the continuous cell line designated as IPLB-Sf21AE11.

5. The two cell lines derived from Adoxophyes orana fasciata were
designated as FTRS-AoL1 and FTRS-AoL2. The cell lines designated as
FTRS-AfL, FTRS-PhL, FTRS-AbL81 and FTRS-HmL45 were derived from Adoxophyes
sp. (smaller tea tortrix), Pandemis heparana, Archippus breviplicanus and
Homona magnanima, respectively. Both the FTRS-H1L1 and FTRS-H1L2 lines
were derived from Hoshinoa longicellana.

6. In FTRS-AoL1, FTRS-AfL and FTRS-AbL81, spindle-shaped and spherical
cells were predominant, while in FTRS-AoL2, FTRS-PhL and FTRS-HmL45 the
cells were mainly spherical. The diameter of a single cell of these lines
was about 25 mum. In FTRS-H1L1 and FTRS-H1L2, the cells assumed an
epithelium like morphology.

7. Results of semi-quantitative analyses carried out by using an API ZYM
kit, showed that the activity of the enzymes concerned was high in all the
cell lines, except for the activity of beta-glucuronidase and beta-
glucosaminidase. The pattern of activity of beta-glucuronidase in the
FTRS-HmL45 cells was different from that of the other cell lines. The
activity of beta-glucosaminidase, in the cell lines FTRS-AfL, FTRS-PhL,
FTRS-AbL81 and FTRS-H1L2 was distinctly weaker than that of the other lines.

8. Inoculation tests of strains of 2 nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPVs)
and an entomopox virus (EPV), namely Plutella NPV (PxNPV), Adoxophyes
NPV (AoNPV) and Adoxophyes EPV (AoEPV) to the cell lines were performed.
In each of the cell lines FTRS-AoL1, FTRS-AoL2, FTRS-AfL, FTRS-PhL and
FTRS-HmL45, only a few cells were infected with PxNPV. About one third of
the cells in FTRS-AoL1 and about 10% of the cells in FTRS-AoL2 were
infected with AoNPV. In FTRS-AfL, only a small percentage of the cells was
infected with this virus. About half of the cells of FTRS-HmL45 were
infected with AoEPV, while the percentages of infected cells were very low
in FTRS-AoL1, FTRS-AoL2, FTRS-AfL, FTRS-PhL and FTRS-AbL81.

In order to investigate an etiological role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a transfer of EBV-genome to cultured
epithelial cells derived from nasopharynx was attempted here. This
transfer or infection of EBV is usually detected by immunofluorescent
staining of EB viral capsid antigen (EB-VCA) or by more sensitive staining
of EBNA (EBV-associated nuclear antigen) in EBV-infected cells. 24 sera
from NPC or NPS (nasopharyngeal sarcoma) patients were screened for the
EBNA staining by ACIF (anti-complement immunofluorescence) test, using a
frozen section material from a NPC patient and 16 cultured cell lines. 3
sera (NPC: 2 and NPS: 1) were, thus, selected for the experimental EBV
infection. These 3 sera were determined to be useful from their positive
EBNA stainings for NPC-tissues and EBV-carrying human lymphoblastoid cells
(HLBC), or their negative ones for human epithelial cells and PHA
(phytohemagglutinin)-transformed HLBC. Other 2 NPC sera of 24 sera gave
either nuclear or cytoplasmic staining 10 of human epithelial cell lines
except 2 non-human cell lines (VERO and THEL cells). This unique staining
by 2 NPC sera appeared to be heterophilic rather than EBV-specific. Its
heterophilic properties were also suggested by a precipitation test in
agar between these sera and histone fraction.

histological and proliferating changes of OST cells and OST-II cells, but
also colony formation, chromosomal and cytokinetic analyses of OST-II
cells were studied in vitro. OST-II cells were heterotransplanted into the
femurs of mice treated with anti-thymocyte serum. Tumor formation was
observed a week after the transplantation and 9-10 weeks later huge
tumors were formed on the transplanted sites, leading to the death of the
mice. This fact showed that OST-II cells had a malignant character. Both
OST cells and OST-II cells were heterotransplanted into femurs of rats
treated with anti-thymocyte serum. The tumors grew fingertip-sized till
the end of 5 weeks after transplantations, but then these tumors began to
regress, and therefore the rats did not die. After both cells were
transplanted into newborn rats intravenously, tumors were observed in
their lungs, and these rats died 30-40 days after transplantations. In
several rats, in which pulmonary tumors had been observed, tumors were
histologically recognized in kidneys, adrenals and brains. In tumor
tissues produced by transplantations of OST cells into femurs of rats,
tumorous osteoid formation were recognized, but not recognized in the case
of OST-II cells. In pulmonary tumors of both cells, osteoid tissues were
not recognized. These tumors which originated in OST cells and OST-II
cells histologically showed alveolar pattern, but by silver impregnation
it was revealed that these tumors were nonepithelial.

In this study, a human undifferentiated carcinoma cell line of the
stomach, KKLS, was established for the purpose of elucidating the
biological characteristics of gastric undiferentiated carcinoma and of
developing a chemosensitivity test for clinical use. Tumor cells isolated
from the metastatic lymph node of a human gastric undifferentiated
carcinoma were grown in epithelioid form. KKLS-S cells were obtained from
a suspension of the primary culture and 3 clones by single cell cloning
from adherent cells. The doubling time ranged from 25 to 30 hrs and the
plating efficiencies varied from 8 to 22%. Chromosomal analysis revealed
translocation from 8q to 14p as a common abnormality. After
transplantation of KKLS-S cells into the nude mouse, a well circumscribed
solid tumor formed with similar histological features to the primary tumor.
Immunohistological and electron micrographic studies identified that they
descended from undifferentiated carcinoma. A chemosensitivity test using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
revealed that KKLS-S cells were more sensitive to vindesine (VDS), and
etoposide (VP-16) than the other 3 gastric cancer cell lines. Out of
tested 10 drugs, carbazilquinone (CQ) was the most sensitive to KKLS-S
cells. This is the first report ever of a undifferentiated carcinoma cell
line of the stomach and it is expected to provide a good experimental
model for various investigations. Already one experimental model using
this cell line, a new chemosensitivity test, liquid top layer-MTT assay
(LMA) has been developed and examined. It is improvement of the MTT assay,
adapting the liquid top layer assay, for eliminating the effect of
fibroblasts. As far as the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer cell lines,
KKLS-S and 3 other additional lines, is concerned, the results of LMA had
a good correlation with those of the MTT assay. The growth of fibroblasts
was restrained by LMA, and the analysis of the inoculated tumor in the
nude mouse revealed that LMA was more reliable for primary culture than
the MTT assay. These studies suggest that the clinical use of LMA can be
expected to bring more accurate results because of the effect of
minimizing fibroblast production.

The first successful propagation of Cowdria ruminantium in vitro was

systems tested allowed little more than limited maintenance of infectivity
of the organism (reviewed by Uilenberg 1983; Bezuidenhout et al 1985; and
Bezuldenhout 1987). Recently, a primary neutrophil culture system for
Cowdria was devised by Logan et al (1987) which, while also of short
duration, did permit intracellular multiplication of the rickettsia with
production of antigen in amounts adequate for serological tests. In this
paper, we report results of efforts to cultivate the heartwater organism
in 11 cell lines other than the E5 line used by Bezuidenhout et al (1985)

lung metastasis in nude mice by subcutaneous implantation. The KUM.LK-2
cell line was established from the 2nd generation of nude mouse to which
human lung adenocarcinoma was serially transplanted. The KUM.LK-2 produced
spontaneous lung metastasis when the cells were subcutaneously implanted
into nude mice. Metastasis was not found in the cases of intra-muscle
implantation and intravenous injection. The KUM.LK-2 cell produced
carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrated antigen 19-9 in vitro, but
these tumor markers were not detected in the serum of KUM.LK-2
transplanted nude mice. From this study the model of spontaneous lung
metastasis of human cancer was established. It is suggested that
metastasis of human cancer in the nude mouse is not dominated only by
blood supply and new vascular genesis. And it may be concluded that the
usefulness of nude mice as an amplifier of tumor marker is bounded by
tumor line.

For the purpose of investigating the possibility of hyperthermic therapy
against choriocarcinoma, an in vitro study was performed by using a
strictly controlled temperature gradient incubator (T.G.I.). The
choriocarcinoma cells, clone GCH-nu-YS derived from an established
choriocarcinoma cell-line designated GCH-nu were placed into condition of
various temperatures (37.0-42.4 Celsius) for about 2 weeks and inhibitory
effect of the cellular proliferation and secretion of Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (HCG) into media were chronologically investigated. When the
cells were cultured at 39.0-39.2 Celsius, the proliferation of YS clone
was nearly as same as that of the cells cultured at 37.0 Celsius. The
proliferation at 39.5-39.6 Celsius was slightly inhibited, whereas it was
inhibited markedly with increasing tendency when cultured over 39.9
Celsius. Above 40.4 Celsius the cellular proliferation was impossible,
thus resulting in destruction of the cells. These data suggest that
temperature upper-limit for proliferation (TLP) is approximately 40.1-40.2
Celsius and temperature upper-limit for viability (TLV) is approximately
40.4-40.6 Celsius. According to Okumura's classification for temperature
sensitivity, it is considered that the choriocarcinoma cells are resembled
to the characteristics of adenocarcinoma. HCG secretion was dramatically
affected by high temperatures, being suppressed until 1/24 of the control
at 39.0-39.2 Celsius at which temperature the cellular proliferation was
not so inhibited. At temperatures over 39.5 Celsius, HCG secretion was
decreased inversely elevating temperatures. And above 40.6 Celsius (over
TLV), HCG secretion was not recognized. From the results of this study, it
is believed that hyperthermic therapy will be a new treatment against
choriocarcinoma in the future.

Objective: Immature natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms are extremely rare.
We established a novel cell line named HATAK from a case of NK cell
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma and describe here the detailed
characteristics of HATAK.

Methods: Cells were cultured in standard medium. After establishing this
new cell line, we performed immunophenotyping of HATAK cells by flow
cytometry-based genotyping by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), and cytotoxicity assay by the 51Cr releasing method
before and after interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 stimulation. We also
investigated the activation status of lymphocyte function-associated
antigen-1 (LFA-1) on chemokine stimulation.

Results: The immunophenotype was positive for CD7, CD13, CD33, and CD56,
and negative for other T-and B-cell antigens. The T-cell receptor gene was
in a germline configuration. Transcripts of the molecules characteristic
for NK cells were detected by RT-PCR. Even under cytokine stimulation,
HATAK cells exhibited neither cytotoxic activity nor IFN (interferon)-
gamma production. Notably, LFA-1 had already been activated in a steady
state, and the stimulation from the fractalkine-CX3CR1 axis never exerted
pressure on its activation status.

Conclusions: HATAK corresponded to the myeloid/NK progenitor based on
normal NK cell ontogeny. This cell line might be useful to elucidate the
biological characteristics of normal NK cells as well as the pathogenesis
of NK neoplasms.

neuritelike or fibroblast like and floating colony like cells. In some
cases of the epithelial like growing cells, the cell morphology was
changed into the view of large cell carcinoma cells, but not in
neuritelike or fibroblast like growing cells.

From March 1986 to March 1987, 18 pulmonary carcinoma cell lines
comprising 7 squamous, 4 adenocarcinoma, 3 adenosquamous, 3 small cell and
1 large cell anaplastic cell line and a pulmonary metastatic cell line
deribed from colon carcinoma were established in long term passages of
more than 3 years. In particular, since November 1986, we have tried to
culture primarily tissue specimens obtained from all cases operated to
examine success rates of cultivation. For 5 months between November 1986
and March 1987. there were 32 cases who were diagnosed as having pulmonary
carcinoma on histodiagnosis and whose cells were primary cultured. Twelve
(38%) of the 32 cases were succeeded to subculture for long term over 6
months. In 10 (31%) of these, long term passage of more than 3 years and
establishment of cell lines were successful. Success rates of cultivation
for long term over 6 months were 9/29 (31%) in non-small cell lung cancer
(3/15 in adenocarcinoma, 5/13 in squamous, 1/1 in adenosquamous) and 3/3
(100%) in small cell lung cancer. Growth characteristics of these 19 cell

We have characterized 4 human squamous carcinoma cell lines established
from the larynx and hypopharynx area. All the cell lines were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium. During the growth they showed monolayer adherence
pattern in culture flask. They showed tonofilament on transmission
electromicroscopy which is characteristic of squamous cell epithelium.
DNA finger-printing using Hinf-1 proved them to be originated from
different beings. Flow cytometric analysis revealed them to show
aneuploidy. Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin was done using
CK1, CK8.13, CK19 and CAM5.2 antibody, and produced various patterns of
positivity. All the cell lines showed varying degrees of tumorigenecity in
athymic nude mice when injected subcutaneously, but only
heterotransplanted SNU-1041 cell line showed continuous tumor growth.
Histopathologic findings of the heterotransplanted tumors were identical
to those of the original tumors of patients. This study suggests that
establishment of many different squamous cell lines might bestow great
capability in researches of the head and neck cancer.

AB   Yes
Objective: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal disease among gynecologic
malignancies. Although many efforts have been made to explore the
mechanisms involved in its development, the genetic events in the
pathogenesis of ovarian cancer are still unclear. We characterized a cell
line (designated OHK) established from a malignant Brenner tumor cell.

Methods: The cells were obtained during the operation of a 43-year-old
Korean woman with ovarian cancer. The OHK cells continuously propagated in
vitro over a period of about 36 months and, to date, have undergone over
200 passages, without being infected by either Mycoplasma or any bacteria.
We measured the doubling time of OHK cells. To investigate the
tumorigenecity of OHK, cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the back
of nude mice. Several tumor markers were analyzed using culture media and
lysates of cytosol. Morphology and ultrastructure were analyzed by phase-
contrast microscopy and electron microscopy. OHK was also analyzed for
gene mutation, the typing of human leukocyte antigen and Flow cytometric
cell cycle analysis and DNA index.

Results: They proliferated in a monolayered sheet showing a pavement-like
arrangement without suppression by intercellular contacts. They also
formed epithelial cell lining in shapes of polymorphism and polygons.
Doubling time was 38.4 hour which was relatively slow compared to other
cancer cells. Microscopic view revealed intranuclear infoldings which are
typical in malignant Brenner tumors. The OHK cells secreted significantly
high level of CA 125 into the culture medium. A 215th codon at exon 4 of
p53 was mutated to C/C in OHK. BRCA1 was a wild type and polymorphisms
were detected in exons 2, 10, 11, 14 and 17 of BRCA2. The cells showed
aneuploidy with DNA index of 1.589 measured by flow cytometry. When
transplanted into nude mice, OHK cells successfully induced tumor which
was histopathologically resembled malignant Brenner tumor.

Conclusions: These results strongly suggest that OHK is a typical cell line
of malignant Brenner tumor. This may provide a useful cellular resource
for studying the pathogenesis of malignant Brenner tumor.

Background and objective: Cancer cell line is the basic material of
various cancer research. Diverse cancer cell lines from various head and
neck regions are needed for biologic research of head and neck cancer.
However, cell lines derived from head and neck cancer are not common.
Recently, we have established and characterized a novel human squamous
carcinoma cell line, PNUH-12, from the hypopharynx.

Materials and methods: Among trials of twenty cases of head and neck
cancer, we established only one specimen succeeded culture passage over 50.
We characterized the cell line as follows: growth pattern and curve,
morphology using phase contrast microscope and transmission
electromicroscope, chromosomal analysis, flow cytometric analysis,
tumorigenecity by xenograft of cell line into nude mouse and morphological
comparison, expression of cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and
vimentin, and P53 mutation and its sequencing.

Results: PNUH-12 showed typical growth pattern of cancer cell line,
representative morphological characteristics of squamous epithelial cell
origin, multiple numerical and structural clonal abnormalities of
chromosome, aneuploidy pattern of flow cytometry, and strong expression of
cytokeratin. The formed tumor of nude mouse showed the identical
histopathological phenotype (squamous cell carcinoma) of the original
tumor of patient and similar morphology of PNUH-12. There was one point
mutation of 78th base, C to G, in exon 7 of P53 gene.

Conclusions: PNUH-12 can be a good control material and successfully
bestowed to researchers for study of biology in head and neck cancer.
There still needed more head and neck cancer cell lines from various
regions and diverse cell types in future.

Treatment of head and neck cancer with cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy has yielded increased complete response rates. In spite of
the initial good response, recurrent cancer after chemotherapy does not
respond to cisplatin based chemotherapy. In recent years, the analogues of
taxol have used in a new chemotherapy treatments for head and neck cancer.
The purpose of this study was to develop the acquired resistance to
cisplatin in head and neck cancer cell line and to study the cross-
resistance of docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as compared to the
parental cells in vitro.

Two different human head and neck cancer cell lines (PNUH-12, SNU-899)
were studied. We developed two cisplatin resistant cell lines (PNUH-12 R1,
SNU-899 R1) by exposing them to near continuous increasing concentration
of cisplatin. The morphology, growth curve of resistant cell lines were
studied and the resistance of these cell lines to the cisplatin, docetaxel
and 5-FU were compared to that of parental cells by MTT assay.

The pattern of growth and shape of PNUH-12 R1 and SNU 899 R1 cell lines
showed similarity to their parent cell lines. The growth curve of these
cell lines were suppressed when compared with the parental cells. When
compared to the parental cells, PNUH-12 R1 cells were 2.0-fold, 3.8-fold,
and 1.4-fold resistant, and SNU 899 R1 cells 3.5-fold, 6.7-fold, and 15.0-
fold resistant to cisplatin, docetaxel and 5-FU, respectively.

In our study, cisplatin resistant cell lines of head and neck cancer have
strong cross-resistance to docetaxel. However, there was difference in
cross-resistance to 5-FU between these cell lines.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes serious and often fatal disease in
dogs. Currently, various cells or cell lines have been used to detect or
produce CDV. In order to set up the conditions, we separated two different
cell lines from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and named as MDCK-F
(fibroblast-like) and MDCK-E (epithelial-like) by Na2EDDA treatment. CDV
seed virus was prepared using MDCK cells and inoculated into MDCK-F and
MDCK-E including MDCK with various ranges of multiplicity of infection
(MOI) to confirm the optimal amount of virus inoculation. The virus titer
of TCID50/ml was calculated by inoculation of serially diluted virus into
96-well plate of MDCK cells. The titer and cytopathic effect (CPE) in MDCK-E
were compared to those in MDCK-F. The titer of seed CDV was 1.24x10^6
TCID50/ml. Optimal MOI was about 0.1 for both MDCK-F and MDCK-E to obtain
highest titers of 10^8 TCID50/ml and 5x10^8 TCID50/ml respectively. CPE in
MDCK-E was shown 4 days after inoculation whether in MNCK-F 5~6 days after
inoculation. We can obtain highest titer of 5x10^8 TCID50/ml with 0.1 MOI
using MDCK-E. MDCK-E was more susceptible for CDV production than MDCK-F.

In vitro cultures of 50 cases of human brain tumors gave rise to 5 cell
lines maintained for more than 1 year. Four lines (KMG-2, KMG-3, KMG-4,
KMG-5) were from malignant astrocytoma and 1 line (KMS II) was from
ependymoma. These 5 cell lines were studied on the following items: light
and electron microscopy, growth characteristics, chromosome analysis,
immunocytochemical staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
S-100 protein, and vimentin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase
(CNPase) activity, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. These investigations
showed heterogeneity and undifferentiated character of the cell lines.
Only KMG-5 line still had high percentage of GFAP-positive cells (about 30%),
whereas the other cell lines contained 0 to a few percent of them. On
the other hand, vimentin was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of all cells of
the 5 lines. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) of cytoskeletal pre-paration further confirmed this observation.
All of the 5 lines had a 57,000 dalton protein (vimentin), whereas
immunoblotting analysis of GFAP demonstrated a distinct 51,000 dalton
protein (GFAP) in only KMG-5 line. Two lines (KMG-4 and KMS II) were found
to have tumorigenicity in nude mice and the transplanted tumors maintained
some characteristic features of the original tumors.

AB   Yes
A continuous adherent tumor cell line, MH1, of 5 years duration has been
established from the bone marrow of a 62-year-old man with systemic
malignant histiocytosis. The neoplastic nature of MH1 is indicated by
structural and numerical chromosome abnormalities with a clonal pattern of
marker chromosomes (including a duplicated 14q+ chromosomal abnormality),
tumor cell colony growth in soft agar, and absence of EBNA. MH1 closely
resembles tumor cells in the original bone marrow aspirate, and both have
cytochemical characteristics of histiocyte/macrophages. They contain large
amounts of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase-inhibited by NaF and acid
phosphatase but are unstained for chloracetate esterase, myeloperoxidase,
and Sudan black B. MH1 has cytoplasmic receptors for Con-A and peanut
agglutinin and surface receptors for transferrin but lacks both
cytoplasmic and surface Ig, B, and T cell differentiation antigens, Ia and
Ki-1 antigens. Although erythrophagocytosis was found in 4% of tumor cells
in the original bone marrow aspirate, erythrophagocytosis by MH1 cells is
rare and not enhanced by treatment with phorbol ester, dimethylsulfoxide,
or supernatants from mixed lymphocyte cultures. Moreover, MH1 does not
appear to produce lysozyme or colony-stimulating factor for myeloid
progenitor cells. Based on these features, the moderate cytologic atypia,
rare phagocytosis, and absence of lysozyme, MH1 is considered to belong to
the poorly differentiated group III of malignant histiocytosis described
by Mendelsohn et al. (Cancer 45:273, 1980). MH1 may be useful to study
markers specific for early histiocyte differentiation and for the
differential diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis.

An activated T-cell line has been established as a continuous suspension
culture for more than two years from IL-2 stimulated Sezary-like cells in
the blood of a 46 year old man with erythroderma and regressing T-cell
skin lesions. Cytogenetics of both the cell line and blood mononuclear
cells before culture reveals the same marker chromosomes t(8;9) (p21;p24)
and t(6;13) (q13;q23). A dermatopathic lymph node two years earlier
showed the same t(8;9) and rearrangements of chromosome 6 at q14.
Interestingly 6q13 is a common fragile site. The clonal derivation of the
cell line was confirmed by T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement
studies showing the same rearrangements of beta-chain genes in the tumor
cell line and mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood. The cultured
cells, which range in appearance from small lymphoid cells to large
multinucleated cells (<10%), express Ki-1 (CD30), Ia (DR), Tac (CD25), T9,
and T11 (CD2) antigens. Absence of T3 (CD3) antigen on the cell surface
was probably due to lack of transcription for TCR beta chain, since mRNA
for TCR alpha and T3-delta, but not TCR beta, was detected in northern
blots. Cell conditioned media contained biological activity for
transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta which promotes anchorage independent
growth of fibroblasts but limits the clonal expansion of T-cells.
Exogenous TGF beta in nanogram amounts surpressed by 20-40% IL-2 dependent
DNA synthesis of the clinically indolent CTCL-line but did not inhibit
growth of L428 cells derived from advanced nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's
disease. These results suggest that TGF-beta may be important in the
growth regulation of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. We conclude that this new
CTCL-line may be useful for further studies of T-cell growth and
differentiation.

Objective: Many discoveries of multi drug resistance (MDR) have resulted
from studies with drug-resistant tumor cell lines as their models. Till
now, there has been no report on the detailed characterization of such a
cell line from lung adenocarcinoma (LA). By long-term exposure of an
established LA cell (A549 cell) to increased concentrations of paclitaxel,
we established a series of subcultures that were considerably more
resistant to this drug.

Methods: Paclitaxel-resistant sublines (A549/TXL) were established in
vitro by exposing to stepwise increased concentrations of the drug in a
cell culture medium. Biological morphology was analyzed by morphometry and
flow cytometry. The chemoresistance indexes of cells were measured by
methyl tetrazolium assay. Evaluation of growth, in vitro drug sensitivity,
and a pharmacokinetic study were performed.

Results: Compared with parent cells, the resistant sublines were smaller
and mixed with giant cells in different sizes and with different numbers
of nuclei. The resistant cells, A549/TXL20 were 19.3 times more resistant
to paclitaxel and 67.4 times more resistant to cisplatin than the parent
cells. The resistant cells also demonstrated cross-resistance to
mitomycin, vinblastine, hydroxycamptothecine, and 5-fluouracil (5-FU).
Compared with the A549 cell line, an unreasonably higher level of drug-
resistance and lower drug concentration was detected in A549/TXL20 cells
after exposure to the drug in the culture medium.

Conclusions: The paclitaxel-induced MDR sublines may be used as an
experimental system for the search of a means to overcome drug resistance
and elucidate possible mechanisms of acquired MDR involved in human lung
adenocarcinoma.

Introduction: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that exhibit embryonic
stem cell-like properties with unlimited self-renewal and multilineage
differentiation properties, are a potential cell source in regenerative
medicine and cell-based therapy. Although retroviral and lentiviral
transduction methods to generate iPSC are well established, the risk of
mutagenesis limits the use of these products for therapeutic applications.

Materials and Methods: In this study, reprogramming of human dermal
fibroblasts (NHDF) into iPSC was carried out using non-integrative Sendai
virus for transduction. The iPSC clones were characterised based on the
morphological changes, gene expression of pluripotency markers, and
spontaneous and directed differentiation abilities into cells of different
germ layers. Results: On day 18-25 post-transduction, colonies with
embryonic stem cell-like morphology were obtained. The iPSC generated were
free of Sendai genome and transgene after passage 10, as confirmed by RT-
PCR. NHDF-derived iPSC expressed multiple pluripotency markers in qRT-PCR
and immunofluorescence staining. When cultured in suspension for 8 days,
iPSC successfully formed embryoid body-like spheres. NHDF-derived iPSC
also demonstrated the ability to undergo directed differentiation into
ectoderm and endoderm.

Conclusion: NHDF were successfully reprogrammed into iPSC using non-
integrating Sendai virus for transduction.

Breast cancer is the first cause of death from female cancer. The
recurrence of the disease originated at the level of secondary organs, or
metastasis, is responsible for 90% of deaths from cancer. The factors that
endow these cells with metastatic functions are largely unknown. One of
the limitations in the study of tumor cells with metastatic phenotypes is
that cell lines maintained in culture lose this ability to invade and
colonize tissues. On the other hand, it has been shown that reinjection of
cells in animals can lead to their enrichment with aggressive phenotypes.
The aim of this work was the isolation and characterization of different
cell populations with differentiated metastatic capacities. Following
inoculation of the F3II murine mammary carcinoma cell lines, we
established cell populations in vitro, one from the primary tumor and
another from a metastatic nodule, F3II TP and F3II NM cell lines
respectively. To determine their aggressiveness, a series of additional
characteristics were compared between these lines and F3II. The three
lines showed variations in morphology in culture and a different doubling
time, with F3II NM having the highest one. Moreover, F3II NM presented
major adhesion capacity and lower clonogenic potential. This could be
explained by the differential expression of cell adhesion molecules, such
as integrins or cadherins analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, the
migration capacity was analyzed by transwell assay and the results showed
differences in this process. Finally, we compared the behavior in vivo and
we detected variations in tumor progression such as latency, frequency of
ulceration, tumor growth and the presence of pulmonary nodules. All things
considered, the establishment and characterization of these two new
different cell lines with differentiated metastatic capacities will allow
us to determine molecular differences involved in the metastatic process.

The characteristics of a cell line HOSM-2, which derived from osteosarcoma
of human mandible, were investigated. The cultures consisted mainly of
polygonal cells, which had an epithelial-like growth pattern with a
tendency to pile up. The cells produced both alkaline phosphatases and
acid phosphatases. Transmission electron micrographs showed the presence
of intercellular collagen filaments. The population doubling time of these
cells was about 74.8 hours. The number of chromosomes ranged widely from
59 to 81 with the modal number being 70. This cell line has passed through
over 112 population doublings since its primary culture 2 years and 6
months previously. These findings suggest that HOSM-2 are osteosarcoma
cells rather than stromal cells. HOSM-2 may be useful in a variety of
studies of human osteosarcoma.

It is perhaps a truism that each of us is greater than the sum of our
parts. This is particularly apparent when it comes to our tissues, our
cells, and their best-known contents, our DNA. In a few cases, such as the
case of a woman named Henrietta Lacks, an individual's tissue contains
such rare attributes as to result single-handedly in a scientific paradigm
shift. More typically, it is the study of vast numbers of tissue samples,
in concert, that allows science to move forward. Indeed, recent genetic
discoveries made possible by the study of vast repositories of tissue
samples known as 'biobanks' have made clear that, when studied in the
aggregate, the biological information contained in each of our individual
bodies can yield scientific insights and medical advances impossible
through the study of any one individual.

But the use of cells and tissues for research brings with it myriad legal
and ethical questions. How should we think about the contributors of these
cells and tissues? Are they - increasingly 'we' as the number of samples
contained in biobanks grows - human subjects of research? And, if so, what
consequences should flow from this classification? Should contributors be
given the opportunity to specify the type of research that they will
permit, or prohibit, with their specimen? Should they be told about
potential profits that may accrue to researchers from the use of their
tissues and, more to the point, be entitled to a share of such profits?
And what about potential health information derived from the
research-should they have access to it? Should others? Even more
challenging, what rules should govern the voluntary provision of tissues
by patient groups to researchers solely for the purpose of identifying the
cause of their disease and developing diagnostics and potential cures for
their condition? And perhaps most thorny of all: if, as some argue,
providing our tissues and cells for research is a moral imperative-part of
our collective civic responsibility-does that give rise to a reciprocal
moral imperative to ensure that all participants have access to the
medical therapies that their cells, among millions of others, helped to
produce.

Stage differentiation of protozoan parasites, such as higher eukaryotic
cells, frequently occurs in response to altered environmental conditions
that produce a reduction in the proliferative potential of the cell. This
is followed by a step where commitment to the differentiation program is
established and changes to the pattern of gene expression occur. To
understand the events that immediately precede and follow the commitment
step, we initiated this study to investigate the molecular changes that
occur during the differentiation of Theileria annulata, a protozoan
parasite of cattle. Using an established in vitro system, where the
macroschizont stage of the parasite differentiates to the merozoite stage,
a time course of differentiation was followed at the polypeptide and mRNA
level. The results of the study showed that during the initial stages of
the differentiation process, there is a low-level expression of genes that
is fully expressed following commitment. This low-level expression was
shown to be reversible before the commitment step, but following this
event, expression became irreversible. The study also showed that the
amplitude of reversible gene expres-sion is directly related to the
ability of different infected cell lines to differentiate. From these
results, a quantitative (stoichiometric) model of stage differentiation
has been postulated. Such a model would explain the asynchrony of
protozoan stage differentiation and the quantitative loss in the ability
of particular parasite clones and lines to differentiate. We believe that
this model is also applicable to higher eukaryotic cells and can account
for the similarities between observations made for higher eukaryotic and
protozoan differentiation systems.

The object of this study was to develop new murine osteoblast-like cell
lines for studying bone cell differentiation. In an attempt to develop
cell lines representing a specific stage in osteoblast differentiation, we
utilized transgenic mice. Immortalized osteoblastic cells were isolated
and cloned from the calvaria of a transgenic mouse containing a 2.6-kb
fragment of the rat osteocalcin promoter driving the expression of SV40
large T antigen. Two clonal cell lines, OCT-1 and OCT-2, were
characterized. T-antigen expression by these two cell lines was confirmed
using T-antigen antibody. Cell lines were tested for their responsiveness
to parathyroid hormone (PTH), prostaglandin B2 (PGE2), 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2),
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and retinoic acid. Their
capacity to produce mineralized bone nodules and to express type I
collagen, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin at the mRNA level
was also evaluated. Osteocalcin expression was found to be very low: OCT-1
and OCT-2 cells injected into nude mice subcutaneously over the surface of
calvaria caused osteosarcomas in 10 and 6 weeks, respectively. Significant
new bone formation was associated with the tumors. OCT-1 and OCT-2 cells
have different response profiles to BMP-2, retinoic acid, PTH, and PGE2.
These results demonstrate that OCT-1 and OCT-2 are cells representative of
different stages of osteoblast differentiation. They have low levels of
osteocalcin expression and may offer a tool to study the role of
osteocalcin in bone formation and mineralization.

alterations in transformants. A parent strain, m5S/1M, served as the
control. Anchorage independence (AG) was not detected in the control
strain, irrespective of culture conditions and population doubling number
(PDN). In the case of transformants, the frequency of AG was increased
with increasing PDN for cl.4103, and was constant for cl.6310,
irrespective of PDN. Karyotype of m5S/1M was 42, X, -Y, +der(6) t(6;13),

retaining sensitivity to 8-azaguanosine (AGR), and the second D98/AGR,
with 60-fold higher resistance to AGR. The mutation rates from the
parental line D98S to D98/AG and from D98/AG to D98/AGR were determined,

elucidated, and the system evaluated for a variety of genetic

Establishment of cell lines and tumorigenicity of human glioma cells were
investigated from the viewpoint of morphological differentiation and
anaplasia. For tissue culture, 82 human brain tumors including.34 gliomas
were used, and 3 glioma cell lines (designated NP-1, NP-2, NP-3) were
established. Cell line NP-1 was derived from an undifferentiated glioma
out of 2, whereas NP-2 from a differentiated astrocytic glioma with mild
anaplasia out of 19, NP-3 from one with marked anaplasia out of 2, and no
cell line from 11 differentiated gliomas without anaplasia. Plating
efficiency and colony formation in soft agar in NP-1 without S-100 and GFA
proteins were higher than those in NP-2 and NP-3 with only a few GFAP
staining cells. After 58 passages NP-1 (10^7 cells) began to produce
tumors subcutaneously in asplenic athymic (lasat) mice in 1.5 months, and
later in athymic (nude) mice in 3 to 8 months. But, after 122 passages
NP-3 produced the first tumor only in lasat mouse in 4 months, and NP-2
(7.5x10^7) had no tumorigenicity in either in 8 months. The histological
features were maintained by serial passaging in nude mice, and so the
tumor cells of heterotransplants of NP-1 had fewer 10nm filaments and
junctional complexes than those of NP-3. It was suggested that
establishment of cell lines and tumorigenicity of human glioma cells were
presumably related to the grade of differentiation: and anaplasia of
glioma cells, and especially to differentiation rather than anaplasia. In
addition, it would be extremely useful for the precise analysis of
tumorigenicity of human glioma cells to use lasat and nude mice together.

expressed on the cell membranes. 3) Isologous transplantations were
carried out using the cell line BMC-L2-20(C1) cultured from the
transplantable cell line (BMC-TL2). The transplantations were
successful, following transfer of the tumor cells to the internal organs,
only in the case of the inoculation of the cultured tumor cell (MATSA was

A new cell line, designated as TMCC-1, has been established from the
pleural effusion of a patient with uterine cervical adenocarcinoma. The
primary culture was performed in January, 1986. The cell line TMCC-1 was
subcultured serially in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS more than 46 times in
March, 1987. The monolayer culture cells showed a pavement-like
arrangement with polygonal cells and had a tendency to pile up without
contact inhibition. PAS and Alcian Blue positive substances could be seen
in the cytoplasm. Desmosome structure, microvilli and secretory granules
were found by electron microscopy. The cell doubling time, saturation
density and plating efficiency were 53 hours, 2.9 X 105/cm2 and 16%,
respectively. Chromosomes analysis revealed hypotriploidy with modal
number of 65. No apparent marker chromosome was present. The nuclear DNA
histogram showed two peaks at 2.8 C and 5.6 C. The TMCC-1 cells were
transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice which developed a low-
differenciated adenocarcinoma resembling the original tumor, and
sialomucin was found in the cytoplasm by High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue
staining. Tumor marker assay of the cultured media revealed significantly
high values of CA125, TPA, SCC and ferritin compared with control media.
By a immuno-histochemical method, CA125 and CEA were demonstrated in the
cultured cells and transplanted tumor.

(4qter->4q21::17p11->17qter),+21,+mar,+mar,7p+,7q+, 13p+. Cytochemically,
they were positive for acid phosphatase and periodic acid-Sciff reaction,
but negative for myeloperoxidase, alfa naphthyl butylate esterase, and
naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase. Electromicroscopically, 90% cells
demonstrated the reaction of platelet peroxidase at the nuclear envelope

They did not have demarcation membrane systems and alpha-granules Under
the surface marker analysis cells were positive for CD33, CD34, HLA-DR,
CD41a, but negative for CD42b, GlyA. From these findings, MG-S cells were
determined to be a megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line. By TPA treatment,
the cell growth was reduced to 83% of control, and cells were
differentiated along with megakaryocyte lineage but not with any other
erythrocyte. myelomonocyte, nor lymphocyte lineage. The cell growth
increased to 130% by GM-CSF but was not changed by IL-3, IL-6, or G-CSF.
No differentiation was obtained by the stimulation of IL-3, IL-6, G-CSF or

Gastric cancer is not only the most frequently seen cancer in Japan, but
also has a variety of histological features among cancers, so it is of
great pathological interest in terms of its origin or cell differentiation.
It is a tumor that is leaning against. On the other hand, in recent years,
culturing of human cancer cells has been enthusiastically attempted due to
various demands, and cultured cell lines are being established for various
types of human cancers. 1. However, the number of gastric cancer cell
cultures established is extremely small. I tried culturing gastric cancer
cells and was able to establish four new subculture strains with different
origin histological types. In addition to these, one strain was
distributed, and morphological search by light and electron microscopy,
xenotransplantation, and induction of cell differentiation by cAMP were
performed on each of the five cell lines. In the wood paper, we report
mainly on the origin and differentiation of gastric cancer cells, and the
relationship between in vitro growth morphology and in vivo histology.

The association of multidrug resistance (MDR) with resistance to lysis by
natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells is
controversial. To address this issue further, drug-resistant variants of a
human Burkitt lymphoma cell line (RAJI) were developed in vitro by
intermittent exposure to adriamycin (R/ADR) or to etoposide (R/VP-16).
The RAJI cell line was selected because it is a standard LAK-susceptible
target. Both MDR lines as well as the parent cell line were found to be
resistant to NK-mediated lysis, but highly susceptible to LAK-mediated
lysis. Notably, R/ADR cells, which express high levels of P-glycoprotein
(P-gp), were nearly eight-times more susceptible to LAK-mediated lysis
than parental cells, whereas R/VP-16 cells, which are P-gp-negative, were
equally as susceptible as parental cells. Immunofluorescence analyses
revealed that expression of cellular adhesion molecules that have been
reported to control susceptibility of targets to NK-and LAK-lysis (ICAM-1,
LFA-1, LFA-3, and MHC class I) did not differ significantly between the
RAJI parent line and drug-resistant variants. This finding suggests that
the increased LAK-sensitivity of R/ADR results from alterations which
affect postbinding stages of the LAK lytic pathway.

To establish a novel cell line from spotted halibut, Verasper variegatus,
primary culture of spotted halibut gill tissue was initiated with methods
of trypsin digestion, and the cells were successfully sub-cultured through
optimizing the medium formulation and culture conditions. The gill cells
grew well at 22 Celsius in DMEM/F-12 medium (pH 7.2) which contained 2%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, carboxymethyl-
chitooligosaccharide, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and insulin-
like growth factor-I (IGF-I). The cells showed fibroblastic shape, grew
rapidly and formed a confluent monolayer after 30 days of cultivation. The
gill cells could be sub-cultured subsequently and maintained their
original growth rate after cryopreservation and resuscitation. The
population doubling time of the cell line was 43.6 hours at passage 60.
Chromosome analysis showed that some cells were chromosomal aneuploidy but
most of them had a modal chromosome number of 46, which had a normal
diploid karyotype of 23 pairs of telocentric chromosomes at passage 60. A
continuous spotted halibut gill cell line has been established which is
being sub-cultured to passage 76 now. The establishment of this cell line
will make great contribution to the study of mechanisms of cell-virus
interactions and the development of viral vaccine for fish viral disease

The antigenicity of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RV) grown in human

were compared to the same type of antigens extracted from mouse infected
cells. The purity of the infected human line was verified by karyotype
analysis and by the cell mixed agglutination test. Group specific rat
antisera reacted in a similar manner with mouse and human derived infected
cells by the complement fixation test. Similar findings were revealed by
immunofluorescence test where no difference could be detected between the
human or mouse infected cells. The virus agglutination test revealed
differences between both viruses. Rabbit anti-mouse RV serum agglutinated
the homotypic but not the heterotypic virus. Group specific rat antisera
failed to agglutinate both types of virus. Gel diffusion studies conducted
with intact and ether treated viruses showed lines of identity with the
nucleoids of the two viruses. The mouse grown virus showed a coat
component which was absent from the human grown RV. The results presented
here indicate that the RV grown in human cells acquires new immunological
characteristics as a result of the new human envelope acquired during
virus formation.

his leukemic blasts consisted of SmIg (lambda and mu chain
immunoglobulins), Ia-like B cell associated antigen (Ia) and common form
of ALL specific antigen (cALL), despite a typical non-T,non-B ALL
phenotype at the disease onset in Oct.'75. Among 8 established leukemia
cell lines (NALM 6-13), there exist some differences in profiles of the

fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and placed in plastic flasks.
The cells grow as a monolayer with a doubling time of 48 hr; they have
been subcultured more than 30 times. When subcultured the cells grow by
extending pseudopods. When densely propagated some grow in sheets and
others stack in layers; individual cells are cuboidal or polygonal in
shape. They contain abundant cytoplasm, with one or two nuclei and
prominent nucleoli. Nuclear chromatin is relatively fine. "Giant forms"
constitute less than 1% of the population. On electron microscopy cells
are equipped with microvilli, tight junction-like structures,
tonofilaments, and a well developed Golgi apparatus. These ultrastructural
findings are similar to those of the original mesothelioma cells. Large
numbers of lipid (or lipo-proteinaceous) granules are present in the
established cells. Karyotypically, the cultured cells are hypotetraploid
(modal number of 81) with several marker chromosomes. The availability of
an established cell line representative of a cancer which has a striking
association with specific environmental exposure is of importance for
multiple areas of research.

Tumor cells acquire resistance to initially effective cytotoxic drugs by
changes in enzyme activity, alteration in drug transport, or reduced drug
retention. Efforts have been made to develop a drug-resistant cell line
and study the mechanism(s) of resistance to the anticancer agent,
mitoxantrone, 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[[24(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]ethyl]-
amino]-9,10-anthracenedione dihydro-chloride (NSC 301739). Resistance to
mitoxantrone was established in human colon carcinoma cells (strain WiDr)
by continuous exposure of cell cultures to increasing concentrations of
drug. After 20 culture passages in the presence of drug, (0.02->0.08
mcg/ml a population of cells (WiDr/R) emerged which was approximately
30-40X more resistant to the cytotoxic effect of mitoxantrone than the
parent (WiDr/S) line; cross resistance to adriamycin was demonstrated.
Resistance to mitoxantrone was stable, evident in WiDr/R cells after >42
cell generations following removal of drug from the culture medium.
Studies with 14C-labeled mitoxantrone revealed that drug uptake was slowed
in WiDr/R cells. Maximum uptake was achieved in 4-5 h in WiDr/S cells
compared to >24 h in WiDr/R cells, and the total amount of drug associated
with cellular DNA of WiDr/R cells was about one-half the amount of drug
associated with DNA of WiDr/S cells. Drug uptake by WiDr/R cells was
clearly enhanced by Tween 80. When incubated in drug-free medium following
drug exposure, WiDr/R cells retained 80% of the drug compared to 100%
retention by WiDr/S cells. These studies suggest that resistance to
mitoxantrone may be due to an alteration of the cell membrane and/or
cytoplasm, resulting in decreased uptake and impaired interaction of drug
with DNA.

AB   Yes
1618K was derived from a male with a primary retroperitoneal embryonal
carcinoma (EC) who presented, with pulmonary nodules, a large abdominal
mass, an alpha-fetoprotein (APP) of 275 ng/ml, and a human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) of 3800 mIU/ml. The testes were normal. Chemotherapy
with 4 cycles of cisplatin, bleomycin and vinblastine (PBV) induced a
partial remission. Further chemotherapy with P,B, etoposide, and
Adriamycin caused a transient complete remission. After 9 cycles of
cisplatin-based chemotherapy, a cytoreductive thoracotomy on 1/27/81
yielded EC. The specimen was seeded in flasks containing mitomycin C-
treated human embryonic lung fibroblast feeder cells (HEL-FFC). The cell
monolayer morphology was similar to other human EC cell lines. The cells
have undergone 60+ in vitro passages and grow well off feeder cells. The
cells produce AFP and hCG. Cell surface antigen analysis reveals stage
specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3), consistent with typical human EC
and SSEA-1, consistent with the presence of differentiated cells.
Morphological changes occur when the cells are seeded at low cell density.
Four of 12 athymic mice inoculated with 1618K developed tumors after a
median of 50 days. AFP and hCG were detected in the serum of tumor-bearing
mice (mean AFP.695 ng/ml, mean hCG=375 mIU/ml). Cells off HEL-FFC produced
EC in mice while cells on HEL-FFC produced tumors containing EC plus
teratoma (well-differentiated epithelial cells arranged in'glands).

Conclusions: 1) 1618K provides an in vitro comparison of gonadal and
extragonadal EC and may provide a model for the study of cisplatin-
resistance in human EC. 2) 1618K cells maintained on HEL-FFC retain
multipotentiality as evidence by antigenic analysis and by in vivo somatic
differentiation.

It is not presently understood why a substantial proportion of established
human solid carcinoma cell lines lack the ability to form tumors in nude
mice (JNCI 59:221, 1977). The VAMT-1 cell line, which was established in
culture from a patient with the sarcomatoid variant of malignant pleural
mesothelioma, was chosen for study of this phenomenon. The original
surgical specimen was also directly grown in nude mice, and the resulting
tumor was sub-passaged for approximately three years. Although the
mesothelial and neoplastic nature of the cultured cells was supported by a
variety of characterization studies (including histochemistry, karyology,
and electron microscopy) this line repeatedly failed to produce tumors in
nude mice. However, when coinjections were performed with a histologically
distinctive human colon carcinoma cell line (RW-2982), tumorigenicity was
restored. The resultant "mixed tumor" grew with areas of both sarcomatoid
mesothelioma and mucogenic colonic carcinoma. Even with additional sub-
passage in the nude mouse, this tumor retained its mixed histology. Since
the VAMT-1 and RW-2982 lines grow exclusively as attached monolayer cells
and as floating mucous-coated organoid structures, respectively, the two
cell lines are easily separated in vitro. After four months (two sub-
passages) in nude mice the mixed tumor was re-established in culture and
the two component cell lines (which appeared unchanged) were separated.
Preliminary studies show that other genuinely tumorigenic cell lines will
also function as "feeder tumors" for the non-tumorigenic VAMT-1. In
summary, there exists a mechanism by which the coinjection of RW-2982
cells can restore tumorigenicity to the VAMT-1 cell line.

The failure of some therapeutic trials as far as the occurrence of newly
developed or intrinsic drug resistance is concerned, has reinforced the
concept of tumor cell heterogeneity. However, investigations in this field
are still limited by the lack of suitable experimental model systems. Five
human melanoma cell lines (JRs) were derived from separate metastatic foci
of a young woman and established in our own laboratory. The main
biological features of JRs lines were characterized either in vitro (in
monolayer cultures, multicellular spheroids) or in vivo (xenografts in
nude mice). In addition, the response of the lines exhibiting an
acceptable plating efficiency in some drugs commonly used in melanoma
treatment, was also investigated and evaluated by means of cell cloning
assays. The JRs lines behave heterogeneously in their in vitro growth,
tumorigenicity in nude mice, clonogenicity as well as in their sensitivity
to cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum (II) and Melphalan. On the contrary, these
lines have shown a similarly high sensitivity to m-AMSA and 4-epi-
doxorubicin. These results demonstrate the biological and functional
heterogeneity existing among multiple melanoma metastases of a single
patient. Moreover, they suggest that JRs lines may serve as a useful model
system to speculate on implications of heterogeneity to melanoma biology
and consequences to anticancer therapy.

The availability of an established cell line from mesothelioma, a human
tumor induced by a known environmental carcinogen, is important both as a
model for carcinogenesis and development of monoclonal antibodies for
improved diagnosis and therapy. A mesothelioma cell line designated MT-1
was established from a pleural effusion of a 71-year old male (blood type
0+) with asbestos exposure. Histologically, hematoxylin and eosin stained
pleural tissue contained highly vascular fibrous thickening, occasional
papillary fronds, and tubules of abnormal mesothelial cells, diagnosed
diffuse malignant mesothelioma, tubulo-papillary type. The pleural
effluent, obtained in 1983 was suspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10%
fetal calf serum, gentamycin, Hepes, and placed in a plastic flask. The
cells grew as a monolayer with a doubling time of 21 hours. When
subcultured, cells from the 4th passage were mixed, containing small,
elongated cells interspersed with flat, polygonal cells. Ultrastructural
findings on electron microscopy include nuclei with one or more nucleoli
and intracytoplasmic lumina. Also, cytoplasm has abundant and impressive
macro and elongated microvilli that show areas of branching. There are
numerous microfilaments with some bona fide tono-filaments and desmosomea.
Karyotypically, the cultured cells are aneuploid, with a modal number of
62. The cell line is monoclonal in origin, and is an abnormal cell line
with marker chromosomes. Given elongated, branched micro-villi,
aneuploidy, ability to induce subcutaneous tumors in the nude mouse,
characteristic histologic appearance, clinical course and history of
asbestos exposure, we conclude MT-1 represents a mesothelioma cell line.

A medullary thyroid cancer cell line, MZ-CRC-1,. was established in tissue
culture originating from a malignant pleural effusion of a 43 year old
white female with metastatic disease. Congo red stains of the tumor of
origin showed amyloid in the matrix. Tumor cells were homogeneously
positive for chromogranin, neuron specific enolase (NSE), calcitonin and
cytokeratins. In tissue culture, MZ-CRC-1 grows in small plastic adherent
clusters of spindle shaped tumor cells with a cell doubling time of 12-16
days. MZ-CRC-1 cells form progressive solid tumors when transplanted to
nude mice. In electron microscopy neurosecretory granules of 70-170nm
diameter are detectable. This corresponds to a positive Grimelius stain of
argyrophilic granules in some but not all tumor cells. By
immunofluorescence microscopy, cytokeratin filaments are detectable both
in cultured MZ-CRC-1 cells and in nude mouse tumors in a fibrillar
arrangement. Neurofilaments are seen in a globular arrangement in cultured
cells. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis of cytoskeletal preparations of
tumors revealed the presence of cytokeratin polypeptides nos. 7, 8, and 18.
The neuroendocrine marker MOC-1 was positive along the cell membranes.
MZ-CRC-1 cells express the disialoganglioside GD3 at the cell surface, a
marker for tissues of neuroectodermal origin. In paraffin sections NSE and
calcitonin antibodies gave a diffuse positive staining of tumor cells. In
tissue culture supernatants CEA and high levels of calcitonin were
detectable. Monoclonal antibodies Leu-7 and NKH1A defining NK cells were
strongly positive with MZ-CRC-1. This is the second known human medullary
thyroid cancer cell line established in tissue culture.

Four new human lung cancer cell lines (LCCL) have been developed in vitro
from surgically resected primary pulmonary carcinoma tissue. These
include: Hop 18 large cell undifferentiated carcinoma, Hop 19 and 62
adenocarcinomas, and Hop 27 large cell undifferentiated/small cell mixed
carcinoma. These 4 new LCCL have been extensively characterized according
to their individual histologic, cytologic, ultrastructural, biochemical
and molecular genetic features and when possible these characteristics
were compared with the original tumor specimens from which they were
derived in order to confirm the authenticity of individual LCCL. Each LCCL
was generally similar to the original tumor specimens from which they were
derived, demonstrating that the LCCL have retained their original
histopathologic, and biochemical characteristics. Individual LCCL were
biochemically characterized for endogenous prostaglandin biosynthesis as
well as metabolism of different xenobiotics including 4-ipomeanol and
benzo(a)-pyrene. Expression of different cytochrome P-450 genes, a multidrug
resistant gene and glutathione-S-transferase gene were also studied
in the 4 LCCL as well as DNA fingerprint analyses using variable tandem
repeat DNA probes. These biochemical and molecular genetic markers were
effectively used to fingerprint the individual LCCL. These new, well
characterized LCCL should be useful for study of the biology of human LC.

Using the established human testicular cancer cell line 833K we have
developed a cisplatin-resistant variant, 833K(64CP) by 1 hour exposures to
increasing concentrations of cisplatin over 24 months with the last 10
exposures at 64 mug/ml (213 muM). The IC50 for cisplatin in the parent 833K
is 0.6 mug/ml compared to 13 mug/ml in 833K(64CP). Soft agar cloning
efficiency in the presence of cisplatin at 16 mug/ml is 16% for the
resistant variant and 0% for the parent line. There is no loss of
resistance over 6 months in the absence of drug and there has been no
increase in the level of resistance with the last 5 exposures to drug.
Cross-resistance to the platinum analogs CHIP and CBDCA is complete.
Karyotypically; the resistant variant differs from the parent by the
presence of 2 nonacrocentric chromosomes containing predominant satellite
stalk regions, although the 2 cell lines have a similar quantity of silver-
nucleolar organizing region staining. Baseline cellular glutathione (GSH)
content as measured by monochlorobimane staining and subsequent flow
cytometry is comparable to the parent and resistant lines, and 6 hour
pretreatment with 50 muM L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine lowers GSH content
in both lines to a a similar degree. Unscheduled DNA synthesis is enhanced
in the resistant line, most prominent after exposure to higher doses of
cisplatin (50 muM and 100 muM). When compared to parent cells, the
resistant phenotype exhibits alterations in proliferative capacity as
manifest by a decreased doubling time and decreased serum requirements, as
well as changes in adhesion, with the spontaneous formation of
multicellular tumor spheroids.

Earlier studies suggested that oval cells were a progenitor of PHC during
methyl-4-dimethylaminobenzene (3-MeDAB) induced liver cancer. Subsequent
investigations have shown that the morphologically-defined oval cell
population is phenotypically heterogeneous and contains cells that can
differentiate into either bile ducts or hepatocytes. In the present
investigation, we have examined the antigenic and biological properties of
a transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma, designated H5D, which was
established in culture from a 3-MeDAB primary tumor. Limiting dilution
cloning of H5D produced several cell lines that expressed the oval cell
antigens, OC.2 and OC.3. Inununofluorescence analysis demonstrated that at
confluency, the clone designated H5D.7 contained cells expressing oval
cell (OC.2, OC.3, OV-1 and OV-6), hepatocyte (cell CAM 105 and
dipeptitlylpeptidase IV), and epithelial (desmoplakin I) markers. After
continuous passage. the H5D.7 clone remained heterogenous with respect to
the expression of oval cell antigens but showed more uniform expression of
hepatocyte markers. Numerous attempts to isolate phenotypically
homogeneous clones from H5D.7 were unsuccessful suggesting that these
cells undergo antigenic differentiation as they grow in culture. This idea
is supported by the observation that following each passage, hepatocyte
antigens were present in only a subpopulations of cells. When H5D.7 was
transplanted subcutanously in rats the tumors were histologically complex
and contained areas of moderately-differentiated hepatocelluar carcinoma,
intestinal metaplasia and ductal structures. Taken together, these
observations suggest that the H5D.7 clone is comprised of multipotential
cells.

The Eker mutation is an autosomal dominant: in the rat that induces renal
adcnocarcinomas among heterozygotes; homozygotes die before birth. It thus
provides an animal model for a putative anti-oncogene. We have established
a panel of 20 cell lines, each derived from an independent renal tubular
adenocarcinorna arising in heterozygotes. Tumor tissue was cultured on
collagen surfaces in a hormone-supplemented, serum-free medium. An initial
outgrowth of thinly spread, apparently epithelial, often multinucleate,
cells gave rise to foci of densely packing cells that were further
propagated as established epithelial cell lines. These cell lines have
been authenticated as to rat origin by cytogenctic analysis, are
epithelial by ultrastructure and immunostaining for cytokeratins and
multiply slowly in soft agarose. Most lines tested arc non-tumorigenic in
nude or scid mutant mice but exceptional lines have produced tubular
carcinomas after implantation into the testes of scid mice. Cytogenetic
analysis shows both numerical and structural karyotypic abnormalities in
all the lines.

Continuously growing lines of cancer cells have been invaluable for
studies on various types of cancer. For prostate cancer, only a few
different lines are available. We have derived three new prostate cancer
cell lines from tissues obtained at the time of prostatectomy. The tissues
were cut into small pieces with sterile scissors placed in keratinocyte
serum free medium (KSFM), centrifuged, resuspended in KSFM and layered
onto tissue culture plastic pre-coated with FCS. Growth was achieved by
culturing the disrupted tissue in KSFM supplemented with huEGF and 2% FCS.
When cell proliferation was evident, the cells were exposed to a
replication-defective retrovirus transferring the transforming HPV16 or
HPV18 E6 and E7 genes, as well as neoR, conferring Geneticin-resistance.
Transformed cells were then selected using Geneticin. All primary
cultures were maintained through crisis until a viable permanent cell line
had been established. These lines are termed OPCT-1, OPCT-2 and OPCT-3. In
a similar way, three new immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell
lines have been derived from prostatectomy tissue. These lines are OPCN-1,
OPCN-2 and OPCN-3. The doubling times (Td), calculated from a series of
growth curves, suggest that the tumor lines proliferate more rapidly than
the normal lines with Td of 1.1 +- 0.02 (SEM) days for OPCT-1, 1.8 +- 0.2
days for OPCT-2 and 1.9 +- 0.3 days for OPCT-3 compared to 2.7 +- 0.5 of
OPCN-1, 2.9 +- 0.5 for OPCN-2 and 2.5 +- 0.5 days for OPCN-3.
Immunohistochemistry results indicate that OPCT-1 is positive for
cytokeratins 18 (CK18+), 5 and 8 (CK5/8+), vimentin, MUC-1 and flotillin.
It is negative for desmin, alpha smooth muscle actin, and factor 8. The
other lines have similar profiles for these markers, although OPCT-2 and
OPCN-1 are only weakly positive for flotillin and OPCN-2 appears to be
negative. For MUC-1, OPCN-2 and OPCT-2 are weekly positive. All lines
appear to be negative for androgen receptor and positive for prostate stem
cell antigen (PSCA). OPCT-2 is negative for PSA whereas the other three
lines appear to be weakly positive. OPCT-3 and OPCN-3 have not been
examined yet. These lines should be valuable tools for prostate cancer
research.

STI-571 (Gleevec, imatinib mesylate) is a kinase inhibitor that
specifically targets the activated Abl oncoprotein and several membrane
tyrosine kinase receptors, including PDGF-R. Both PDGF ligands and
receptors are often overexpressed in gliomas, suggesting the existence of
an autocrine stimulatory loop. It is known that PDGF-R signals mainly
through PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways. PI3K/Akt is a major cell survival
pathway and constitutively active AKT2 has been demonstrated to confer
cisplatin resistance. In a previous study, it has been shown that STI-571
inhibits the growth of the human glioblastoma cell line U87-MG in nude
mice. In the present study we compared STI-571 antiproliferative activity
on U87-MG and on its cisplatin-resistant variant U87-MG/Pt. U87-MG/Pt was
selected in our laboratory by culturing cells in stepwise increasing
concentrations of cisplatin (resistance index ~ 10) and displays a lower
level of PDGF-R protein expression than U87-MG. Unexpectedly, U87-MG/Pt
cells were significantly more sensitive to STI-571 than U87-MG (IC50
values = 18.6 +- 3.9 muM vs. 32. 6 +- 3.9 muM, respectively; P<0.0005,
two-tailed Student's t test) in a 3-day growth inhibition assay. Similar
results were obtained in clonogenic survival assays. Treatment of both
cell lines with STI-571 resulted in a dose-and time-dependent down-
regulation of PDGF-R protein expression, starting as soon as 8 hrs from
cell exposure. Interestingly, STI-571 (25 muM) increased p21 protein
expression in a p53-independent manner and inhibited phosphorylation of
Akt, without affecting Akt level of expression, only in U87-MG/Pt cells.
By contrast, no inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was observed in U87-MG,
not even when higher concentrations of STI-571 (up to 50 muM) were used.
We are currently evaluating whether the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation
results in a higher induction of apoptosis in U87-MG/Pt. In both cell
lines, STI-571 increased the level of phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK, thus
suggesting that STI-571 efficacy may be potentiated by co-treatment with
MEK 1/2 inhibitors. These findings confirm that STI-571 is active in
glioblastoma cell lines. More interestingly a cisplatin-resistant variant
shows a clear-cut higher sensitivity to STI-571, and the data available so
far suggest that Akt might be involved in the mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon. We are presently studying whether cisplatin-resistant cell
lines from other tumors are also more sensitive to STI-571, and the
resultant clinical implications.

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive tumor that frequently spread
thoracic cavity. In addition, since it is refractory to conventional
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, prognosis of patients with MM is very
limited. To clarify the molecular pathogenesis of MM and develop novel,
more effective therapeutic modalities, experimental animal models which
resemble clinical behavior of MM are indispensable. Here, we report
orthotopic-implantation SCID-mouse model of human MM cells. In the present
study, we used two human MM cell lines, named EHMES-1 and EHMES-10,
established from two different patients. EHMES-10 cells secreted 10 times
higher level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein compared
with EHMES-1 cells. Both two cell lines overexpressed epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2
(VEGFR-2). When MM cells were inoculated into thoracic cavity (orthotopic
site) of SCID mice, EHMES-1 cells did not produce any tumors or pleural
effusions by day 84. On the other hand, EHMES-10 cells reproducibly
produced tumors (2-5 mm in diameter) accompanying with pleural
dissemination and bloody pleural effusions (up to 1ml/mouse) by day 35.
Treatment of EHMES-10-bearing SCID mice with cisplatin or gemcitabine,
those are considered as effective chemotherapeutic agents for MM patients,
on day 7 inhibited production of pleural tumors and pleural effusion.
These results suggest that pattern of progression and chemosensitivity of
orthotopically implanted EHMES-10 cells resemble those of MM patients.
Therefore, our patient-like orthotopic model with EHMES-10 cells may be
useful for examining molecular pathogenesis and contribute to develop the
novel treatment strategy for MM.

Paired cell lines have been derived from tumor and adjacent normal tissue
from three prostate cancer specimens. These lines were immortalized with
genes from human papilloma virus. The line OPCT-1 was from a tumor sample
obtained from a 68 year old patient with TNM Stage T1cN0M0 and a Gleason
score of 6 (3+3). The OPCN-1 line was from the adjacent normal tissue of
this patient. The OPCT-2 and OPCN-2 lines were similarly derived from a 58
year old patient with T2aN0M0 and Gleason score of 5 (2+3). The OPCT-3 and
OPCN-3 lines were from a 54 year old patient with T3aN0M0 and Gleason
score of 4 (2+2). None of the patients received chemo-or hormonal therapy
before surgery. The doubling times of the OPCT-1 (1.1d) and OPCT-2 (1.8d)
lines in culture are shorter than those for their adjacent normal lines
(OPCN-1 = 2.7d; OPCN-2 = 2.9d). In contrast, the doubling time for OPCT-3
(2.1d) is not significantly different from that for OPCN-3 (2.3d). In a
methylcellulose-based clonogenic attachment-independent growth assay, only
the three tumor-derived lines formed colonies in these cultures,
indicating that they are tumor derived. The results of spectral karyotype
analysis from 10 mitotic figures each demonstrated variable chromosome
numbers and numerous aberrations (both clonal and non-clonal). OPCT-1 has
an average number of 49 (range = 48-50) chromosomes with trisomy 8, 9 and
20 observed for almost all mitotic figures, plus a chromosome 5 fragment.
Two clonal translocations were detected as t(3;8) and t(9;19). The range
of chromosome numbers was 60-86 for OPCT-2 and there were multiple
chromosomal fragments. Two clonal translocations were detected as t(1;3)
and t(4;5). For 7 out of 10 mitotic figures, non-clonal chromosomal
aberrations (translocations) were detected indicating an unstable genome.
The chromosome numbers of OPCT-3 vary from 62-110. Three clonal
translocations were detected as t(10;21), t(20;13) and dic(14;14). The
adjacent normal lines also had aberrant karyotypes with multiple
non-clonal aberrations. The range of chromosomes numbers were 59-84 for OPCN-1
with two clonal translocations [t(9;17) and t(9;19)], 78-94 for OPCN-2
with two clonal translocations [t(4;19) and t(19;4;19;4;19)], and 62-78
for OPCN-3 with four clonal translocations as [t(3;14), t(1;10;14), t(14;
15), and t(6;22)]. These results indicate that although the lines derived
from adjacent normal tissue are functionally different from the tumor
derived lines, the karyotype analysis indicates that they have a
considerable degree of genomic instability. This may reflect the inherent
diversity and heterogeneity of the cancerous prostate gland.

Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States
with an estimated 130,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Many cases are
asymptomatic and not diagnosed until late stage of disease. Identification
of primary tumors at an earlier stage is advantageous in treatment
planning and aids in decreasing the morbidity/mortality rate from
recurrence. The aim of our studies is to establish a xenograft system for
monitoring tumor growth and metastasis in vivo which allows continual
evaluation of drug and drug regimen efficacy at all stages of tumor
progression. LoVo-6-luc-1, a luciferase expressing cell line derived from
LoVo human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, was injected by various routes
(subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intracecal) into female SCID-bg mice.
Tumor growth and metastatic spread was monitored weekly by in vivo imaging
using the Xenogen IVIS imaging platform. Visible bioluminescence signals
were detected immediately after injection and high tumor take was seen in
all of the models. In the subcutaneous model, we found a high correlation
between mean bioluminescence and mean tumor volume. In the intraperitoneal
and ceacum injected models, the onset of tumor spread was rapid and ex
vivo imaging confirmed metastasis to multiple organs such as liver, lung,
kidney, adrenal gland, spleen and ovary.

The redheaded pine sawfly, Neodiprion Lecontei (Fitch), is an economically
important pest of young pines in eastern Canada and the U.S.A. (Wilson and
Reeks 1967). To facilitate study of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus that is
very virulent for this sawfly (Bird 1961), ten sawfly cell lines were
isolated from embryonic tissues. We have undertaken a chromosomal study of
these cell lines to confirm their sawfly origin, and to determine whether
or not they could be distinguished from each other on the basis of their
chromosome complement. There are several reports (Herrick et al. 1970;
Greene et al. 1972) of incorrect identification of vertebrate and insect
cell lines because of cross contamination and/or mislabeling. We carry
several lepidopteran cell lines which could be a source of contamination
for new cell lines. Chromosomal characteristics of the lepidopteran cell
lines have been reported previously (Ennis and Sohi 1976). In this note we
analyze the chromosomal complement of the sawfly cell lines.

Plasmodium cynomolgi oocysts of varying ages were placed in culture with
cells from primary cultures as well as from an established cell line of
Anopheles stephensi. Four day old oocysts showed the least favorable
response to in vitro culture, whereas 6 day old oocysts responded
primarily by growth and 8 day oocysts by differentiation. There were no
striking differences in the response of P. cynomolgi oocysts to cells of
the established line versus those from the primary cultures. Cells from
adult tissue were no more effective than those from larval tissues in
promoting development of the parasites in vitro. However, the oocysts
invariably did better when cultured together with A. stephensi cells,
regardless of origin, than in medium alone. Refinements in culturing
techniques and the design of media will inevitably lead to the development
of cell cultures, both primary and established, which more adequately
reflect the in vivo milieu. More substantial results in culturing the
insect cycle of malarial parasites should then be forthcoming.

of 18 mo. in Leibovitz's L-15 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum at a
temperature of 32 +- 1 degree Celsius. The EK-1 cell line consists of
epitheloid cells with micro-or macro-nuclei and fibroblastic cells.
Multinucleated epitheloid cells were present in most of the cultures. The
results of chromosome analysis for the EK-1 cell line revealed that the
chromosome numbers counted from 100 metaphase cells show a bimodal
distribution ranging from 21-62, with a modal number of 38, which is
similar to that of normal eel somatic ells. When subjected to low seeding
densities, the EK-1 cells showed a low plating efficiency, which might
result from the non-transformation of the cells. The cells were
susceptible to Eel Virus America (EVA), Eel Virus Europe (EVE) or Eel
Virus Europe X (EVEX). The EK-1 cell line was demonstrated to be free of
bacterial, fungal and mycoplasmic contamination.

AB   Yes
STR loci used in today's STR profiling kits come from multiple
chromosomes, and the technique can generate a full STR profile even in the
presence of microsatellite instability. So I find the absence of STR loci
in these profiles from CABA I puzzling. Some additional testing is needed
to further explore these findings. 1) It is important to perform separate
species testing to confirm that CABA I is of human origin. STR profiling
is typically considered species-specific, however, it has been clearly
documented that related species can be detected. This has been documented
previously by Almeida et al (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22059503),
Ren et al (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22206866), and others. STR
profiles generated from non-human species can produce patterns similar to
those seen here. 2) Human cell line STR profiles have clearly defined
quality criteria, including some requirements that are unique to cell
lines (see ANSI/ATCC ASN-0002-2011 Authentication of Human Cell Lines:
Standardization of STR Profiling). To my eye, the electropherograms seen
here do not meet all quality criteria. It would be helpful to see other
cell lines used as positive controls alongside CABA I data, to demonstrate
adherence to quality criteria, in addition to the "typical male" and
"typical female" results shown here.

Background: Previous research in our laboratories has shown that
Clomipramine Hydrochloride (CLOM), a tricyclic antidepressant in use for
over thirty years, selectively kills neoplastic glial cells in vitro
whilst leaving normal brain cells unaffected. The purpose of this study
was to evaluate whether a range of early passage cell cultures and
established cell lines, derived from a number of patients with malignant
glioma, would display different sensitivities when exposed to CLOM. The
particular assay of interest, following our discovery that CLOM targets
the mitochondria of tumour cells and triggers caspase 3 mitochondrially-
mediated apoptosis, was annexin-V flow cytometry. This assay was used to
determine the mechanism of cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis,
according to drug concentration and period of incubation.

Methods: Cells grown to 90% confluence in 25cm3 flasks were incubated with
concentrations of CLOM from 20muM-100muM, for up to 6 hours. Cells were
harvested and resuspended in calcium binding buffer, which triggers
translocation of calcium-regulated phosphatidylserine residues to the
nuclear envelope, before removing 500mul of the single cell suspension to a
FACS tube. Controls used in the analysis were performed by omission of the
drug incubation in one flask, and addition of 1muM staurosporine to one
flask. These served as negative and positive controls respectively.
annexin-V FITC and propidium iodide were added to all tubes and incubated
for 15 minutes at room temperature, in the dark. Subsequent to this,
binding buffer was added to each tube and analysed using a BD FACScalibur.

Results: Results show that, of the five malignant gliomas tested, the two
established cell lines had the lower apoptotic threshold, with a
significant percentage of apoptotic cells present at 60muM and above when
compared to the control sample. The three early passage cultures,
developed 'in house' from biopsy, had higher apoptotic thresholds,
withstanding up to 100muM CLOM incubation for six hours. Normal human
astrocytes were assayed in parallel, and show that CLOM does not cause
cell death at the concentrations tested.

Conclusions: It may be possible, in a larger study, to predict individual
patient response to CLOM using the annexin-V assay, alongside Bcl-2
analysis and CYP gene testing, on the individual patient's tumour cells.
The difference in sensitivities between glioma, in this small study,
indicates the importance of analysing early passage cultures, which retain
original morphology and characteristics to a greater extent, alongside
established cell lines.

Cisplatin resistance has been induced in human HT-29 and HeLa cells after
low-dose fractionated gamma-irradiation. The drug resistance is modest and
does not confer cross-resistance to irradiation. Alterations that were
recently shown to correlate with radiation-induced cisplatin resistance in
murine cells are not involved in the resistant HeLa-C3 cells. Scavengers,
such as GSH or metallothioneins are unchanged and there is no alteration
of the cGMP transduction pathway. Preliminary results in HeLa-C3 cells
indicate that resistance is associated with differences of the apoptotic
pathway, with enhancement of the p53 suppressor protein after cisplatin
treatment but unchanged bcl-2 protein expression.

The development of the hybridoma technology (1) has allowed the production
of specific monoclonal antibodies which provide unique and invaluable
reagents for a variety of applications. The reliable production of
hybridoma cell lines is dependent on the availability of a suitable
myeloma cell line to act as a fusion partner for antibody-forming cells
While several cell lines exist for this purpose, none has in experiments
in our laboratory fulfilled all of the criteria for an ideal fusion
partner. These would include: 1) Rapid growth rate. 2) Growth in cheaper
tissue culture media (eg media supple-mented with horse serum rather than
the expensive fetal calf serum). 3) The line and its hybridoma descendents
should be readily clonable In soft agar or by dilution. 4) No production
of immunoglobulin (Ig) chains by the line. 5) High frequency of fusion
with antibody-forming cells. This assumes freedom from mycoplasma
contamination. 6) All stages in the generation and cloning of hybridomas
should be independent of feeder cells. 7) Hybridomas should be stable
producers of the monoclonal antibody. 8) Hybridoma cells should not die
under crowded conditions of culture (eg neglect over a weekend!).

This report describes the production of a line which has all these
characteristics using as the starting point the line P3-Ag8-gamma1- an Ig-
non-secretor clone of P3-X63-Ag8. The line P3-Ag8-gamma1- produces
intracellular kappa light chains (kappa) which are expressed in derived
hybridomas, resulting in 'scrambled' antibodies.

Aim: To establish a continuous functional and non-tumorigenic human
parathyroid cell line.

Material and methods: Nineteen tissue samples from 15 patients subjected
to parathyroidectomy due to primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism were
obtained. Functional, morphological and tumorigenic properties of the
obtained cells were analyzed.

Results: After two months of culture in conditions of immortalization,
cells had an exponential growth without experiencing senescence.
Therefore, more than 200 sub cultures have been performed. The cell line
was denominated RCPTH. Morphological characterization showed monolayer
growth with contact inhibition and a duplication time of 30 hours. On
light microscopy, pleomorphism and low number of mitoses were observed.
Cells accumulated glycogen, expressed calcium sensing receptor and had
positive PTH cytoplasmic clusters. The line secreted PTH initially but
subsequently, PTH production became undetectable. The cell line did not
have tumor or metastatic growth.

Conclusions: A parathyroid cell line has been established. The lack of PTH
production is a problem that will require the search for mechanisms to
activate it.

AB   Yes
Introduction: The identification of viral serotypes is an important issue
for dengue diagnosis. Despite the existence of other identification
methods, the viral isolation in cell cultures and determination by
immunofluorescent technique remain as the most used. Therefore the search
for more sensitive cellular systems has been a repeated topic during many
years for dengue virus and other agents. Objective: to obtain a cell
subline from CLA-1 clone (Aedes pseudoscutellaris), that grows at 28
Celsius, capable of multiplying at 33 Celsius (CLA-HT) and to evaluate its
usefulness for Dengue virus isolation and identification.

Methods: By using a CLA-1 clone of the AP-61 (Aedes pseudoscutellaris)
cell line, it was possible to obtain a strain or cell subline CLA-HT
capable of growing at 33 oC (CLA-HT) through a temperature selection
method. Its sensitivity for the multiplication of the 4 dengue virus
serotypes and its efficiency for direct virus isolation from acutely ill
patients' sera were studied in comparison to C6/36 HT cell line (A.
albopictus).

Results: Four dengue virus serotypes grew in CLA-HT cell subline but some
serotypes were detected later in CLA-HT than in C6/36 HT. For dengue
isolation from serum samples taken in acutely ill patients, the CLA-HT
subline detected 40% positive samples whereas C6/36 HT did 50%.

Discussion: CLA-HT is able to detect all dengue virus serotypes from 96
hours on post inoculation. It makes the new cell line useful for research
as an alternative system and the direct isolation efficiency is good to be
applied in large outbreaks. The most important advantage of CLA-HT is the
possibility of giving rapid answer in emergency situations in low resource
laboratories since it does not require special incubation conditions with
CO2.

Conclusions: A CLA-HT subline was obtained from CLA-1 line and it grows at
33 Celsius and capable of detecting 4 dengue virus serotypes. Its
isolation efficiency is slightly lower than that of C6/36 HT subline, but
it may be used as an alternative system for dengue virus isolation, mainly
in resource-poor laboratories that do not have the optimal conditions for
incubation.

This work describes the morphological, chromosomal and presence of
desmosomes of a cell line (CaLo) derived from a biopsy of cervical cancer.
Our results indicate that CaLo has a typical morphology of epithelial
cells, a chromosomal aneuploidy with modal number of 58 and the presence
of desmosomes of bead to membrane positivity for the presence of
desmoglein-1. From CaLo a clone called KaLo was also isolated. This
cloning gives us evidence of the malignant origin of these cells. Both
cell types were cultured in the presence of some cytokines recently used
in certain clinical protocols (TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-3 GM-CSF, M-CSF and
IFN-gamma). Our results demonstrate an inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha, IL-3
and GM-CSF proliferation, whereas with M-CSF and IFN-gamma, no effect was
detected. On the other hand, we observed an increase in cell proliferation
in the presence of IL-2. These results suggest that TNF-alpha, IL-3 and
M-CSF may have clinical applicability because of their inhibitory properties;
While highlighting the risk of using in vivo IL-2, as it activates the
proliferation of tumor cells of the cervix, as has been reported for some
head and neck carcinomas.

In order to determine whether the cell strains obtained from seven
cervical biopsies (five from cervical cancers and two from normal cervical
tissue) arose from epithelial tissue, the presence of desmoglein-1 (DG-1)
was evaluated using a polyclonal antibody against desmoglein-1 (anti-DG-1).
Although some strains had a typical fibroblast morphology, all were
positive for anti-DG-1. In consequence we assumed that all strains
consisted of epithelial cells. On the other hand our results showed that
cells from biopsies taken from patients with more advanced tumors
presented lower levels of DG-1 than cells from patients in early stages. A
discussion is provided as to whether these differences in DG-1 content can
be related to the metastatic properties of the tumor.

Recently, different antitumor immunotherapy approaches have not produced
expected results in clinical applications. One conceivable explanation for
this is that tumor cells can escape immunosurveillance or induce tolerance
to CTL. A diversity of tumor-induced factors has been described, that are
able to block immune response against tumors. In a this paper we analyzed
the expression level of a ligand to inhibitory receptors of lymphocytes -
the HLA-E molecule - in melanoma cell lines derived from patient biopsy

Establishment of the cell line (HOS-O) of osteosarcoma was successfully
accomplished. The materials for this study were obtained from surgically
removed tumor mass metastasized to the lung. The patient was a 10 year-old
girl, suffering from an original tumor in the right distal femur. The
tissue culture has been started in September 1977, and the cell line has
been maintained in a good condition for about five years. The shape of
cultured cells is elongated-spindle and its chromosome number is 46. By
histochemical examination, the cells revealed weakly positive at alkaline
phosphatase, and moderately positive at acid phosphatase, and highly
positive at nonspecific esterase and 5'-nucleotidase. Each of twice
transplantations of those cells, to the back of nude mice, was successful.
Histological features of the trasplanted tumors were resembled to that of
the original sarcoma, showing a remarkable formation of osteoid tissue.

The surface properties of neoplastic cells receive increasing attention
because surface alteration accompanies and may even cause altered growth
properties and tumorogenicity. The Mahlavu line of human hepatoma cells
was studied by scanning electron microscopy and compared with human
diploid fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Cultures were grown on glass
coverslips in medium 50:50 containing 10% fetal calt serum. Coverslips
were drained, then washed in phosphatebuffered saline, placed in 1%
osmium tetroxide for 10 min and taken step-wise through decreasing ethanol
and increasing amyl acetate mixtures, ending in pure amyl acetate.
Specimens were then dried from liquid CO2, in a Sorvall critical-point
drying apparatus. Preparations were coated with carbon followed by gold
and examined in a modified JSM-U3 scanning electron microscope of the
National Physics Research Laboratory, CSIR. Specimens were tilted at 30
degree to 45 degree and observed at 30 kV. Photographs were taken with a
Polaroid camera and stereo images could be obtained by taking successive
photographs at different angles of tilt. Treatment with osmium tetroxide
was found to be obligatory for satisfactory specimens. The surface of the
Mahlavu cell shows a very large flat cytoplasmic area, ending in an
undulating membrane with large numbers of microvilli. The flat cytoplasmic
'skirt' has some ruffles at the edges and is fringed by long slender
filopodia which reach across intercellular gaps. A prominent feature,
especially of cells at confluency, is the presence of large numbers of
cytoplasmic blebs. These blebs have constrictions at their bases and are
often shed. The blebs may serve an excretory or secretory function.
Microvilli sometimes originate from blebs. Mahlavu cells could be readily
distinguished from fibroblasts and HeLa cells and their surface morphology
resembles that of papovavirus transformed cells described by Porter and co-
workers. Different methods of drying and fixing of cells caused gross
variability in morphology and standard methods should be employed.

established from 15 patients in children. Four neuroblastoma cell lines
(SCMC-N2-N5) had N-myc amplification, three of them had DMs, and remaining
one had HSRs. One of the two rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (SCMC-RM1, RM2)
had N-myc amplification and t(9:13). Two Wilms tumor cell lines (SCMC-W1,
W2) were derived from rhabdoid type, and two Ewing sarcoma cell lines
(SCMC-ES1, ES2) had t(11:22). One cell line derived from malignant
mesenchymoma had the capacity of differentiation into muscle or neuron,
suggesting to be of undifferentiated stem cell origin. SCMC-L1 derived
from infant ALL expressed early precursor B lineage, and SCMC-L2 with Ph1ALL
expressed both lymphoid and myeloid antigens, having mixed lineage

Animal cell cultures have become indispensible for several applications.
Their utility for research and biotech industrial applications are growing
exponentially and these support a parallel growth in the imaging,
analytical and other related technologies. As with the increasing number
of available cell lines, there is a tremendous ongoing progress in the
?elds of instrumentation, durables, consumables and supplements that make
cells grown in vitro more efficient. Cell cultures have become integral for
research in a wide range of areas and there is a constant evolution in the
cell based assays/techniques. Sources of cell lines are important as they
not only provide the required cell lines, they form cell line repositories
and can provide authenticate information of the cell lines being supplied.
This is critical to ensure consistent and reliable data from work
involving cell lines. In this manuscript, various prominent sources of
cell lines are presented including a brief description, their web site
addresses and their contact details. It is hoped that this compilation of
major sources of cell lines would be useful for many researchers as a

A human primary liver carcinoma cell line has been established in vitro in
1981, which was designated as YY-8103. Specimen of the primary liver
carcinoma was obtained from a 60-year old male patient at operation. This
cell line has been transferred through more than 130 passages. The
characteristics of the cell line are as follows: Morphologically, the
cells are polygonal epithelial-like. The nuclei are large in size and
irregular in shape, and mitosis can be seen under EM. The mode of
chromsome numbers of the cell line was 64. Heterotransplantation was
successfully achieved in nude mice, in which the features of the
histological section were in accordance with those of the original
specimens. The tumor nodules of nude mice could be retransplanted and
recultured in vitro. An anomalous pattern of LDH isozyme for the cell line
was found with the highest activity of LDH-3. No HBsAg was detected in the
culture medium nor in the homogenized cell but AFP was positive in sera of
nude mice with growing tumor nodules. The suspension of the cell could be
agglutinated by Con-A. The cell line is susceptible to measles virus and
herpes simplex virus, Therefore, the YY-8103 cell line may be used in the
basic investigation of liver carcinoma and virus culture.

Two cell lines from pupal ovaries of Ectropis obliqua (SIE-EO-801, SIE-EO-803)
have been established since 1980. They have been transferred for more
than 73 passages and maintained for about one and a half year up to now.
They mainly consist of three cell types: epithelial-like, spindle-shaped
and round cells. The SIE-EO-801 line grows as monolayer culture and SIE-EO-803
line as both monolayer and suspension cultures. The type of
chromosomes reveals that it belongs to the karyotype of Lepidoptera. The
size of them are rather small and short, and the number varies greatly
from less than 30 to more than 200. Thus, it is impossible to count
accurately the number. In studying their characteristics, we found that
some differences exist between these two cell lines with respect to growth
behavior, morphology and enzyme activities. Ectropis obliqua is a major
pest of tea trees. The cell lines established from their ovary may thus be
used in the study of the biology of this insect.

sensitive. It is demonstrated that GCRV, in vitro, has no strict species
specificity. Typical symptom of muscular hemorrhage could be replicated
when fingerlings of grass carp were infected with the virus which had been
propagated in GCK-84. The virus produced by GCK-84, GCTF-2, CAB-80, BCC

Objective: To investigate whether cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells affected
platelet aggregation via activation of thrombin and cyclooxygenase.

Methods: Human cholangiocarcinoma (HuCCA) cells were cultured in T-75
Flasks with a standard technique. Cells were grown to confluence until
used, after which, cells were detached and then resuspended in DMEM.
Resuspended HuCCA cells were assessed for their effects on inducing
platelet aggregation of normal volunteers using Born's technique. Hirudin,
apyrase, EDTA and indomethacin were used as pharmacological tools to
investigate signaling mechanisms.

Results: HuCCA cells can initiate aggregation of platelets in heparinized
platelet rich plasma (hPRP). The potency of HuCCA cell induced platelet
aggregation depends on the concentration of cell suspension.
Interestingly, HuCCA cell induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by
hirudin (10, 20 and 40 unit), EDTA (2, 3 and 4 mM) and indomethacin (0.1,
1 and 2 mM) in a dose dependent manner but not by apyrase (5, 10 and 20
units).

Conclusion: HuCCA cells can induce platelet aggregation possibly via
activation of thrombin and the cyclooxygenase signaling pathway but not
the ADP pathway. Calcium may be an important factor required for this
reaction.

be considered. Among the samples they prepared for the journey were
cultures of bacteria Escherichia Coli and human cancerous cells known as
HeLa. Despite the reality of the Cold War, the team led by microbiologist
N.N. Zhukov-Verezhnikov had acquired vials of HeLa cells from their
American colleagues several years earlier. In fact, these cells made it to
space prior to Gagarin, as they were on board the satellite Korabl-Sputnik
2 in 1960 [1]. HeLa cells were known since 1951 when George Gey, a
scientist from the John Hopkins University Medical Center in Baltimore,
US, managed to turn tissue taken from a cervical tumor of a 30 year old
African American woman into the first immortal line of human cells.

Based on the fluorescence properties of adriamycin (ADM), fluor-escence
emission spectra of this drug were recorded at the single cell level using
a highly sensitive microapectrofluorometer. Spectra were obtained from
micrometer regions in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of single living
tumor cells which originated from culture or from mice ascitic tumors. In
sensitive ADM treated cells, ADM spectra show that the drug does not
interact during its cytoplasmic transit but intercalates in nuclear DNA in
a similar way to that obtained when ADM is combined With calf thymus DNA.
With ADM resistant leukemic cells, no intracellular fluorescence signal
was recorded either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus which suggests an
inhibition of the drug uptake by resistant cells. By increasing
extracellular concentration of ADM, resistant cells allowed the drug to
penetrate but no signal of free or intercalated drug was observed.

survived for 5 years and passed over 500 generations. Methods and Results
1. Establishment of cell lines: 1. Source of material: TJ899 cell line was
obtained from a surgically removed specimen of a male patient with
occipital glioma. The TJ905 in vitro cell line was obtained from a male
TOP glioma patient. Both were diagnosed as glioblastoma multiforme by
histopathology. 2. Construction: After aseptic conditions, the tissue was
rinsed with Hanks' solution to remove blood and visible electrocautery and
necrotic tissue. Mechanically fragmented, inoculate the tissue block in a
25cm~2 flask, add Waymouth's MAB 87/3 (Gibco Lab, USA) containing 15%
fetal bovine serum (FCS), incubate at 37 Celsius, 5% CO2 72 hour. Most
tissue blocks have different degrees of cell migration, and the cell body
is small. After 1 week, most of the culture flask walls are full of cells.

It is known that glucagon is synthesized via a large precursor molecule
and that conversion of the precursor to glucagon is accomplished by
selective proteolytic cleavage of proglucagon. lmmuno-reactive glucagons
(IRGs) with various molecular weights were obtained from acid-ethanol
extracts of glucagon-producing tumor cells (ITC-1) in Syrian golden
hamster by gelfiltration on Bio-Gel P-30 and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B.
The biological activity of various IRGs in vitro was examined by measuring
the release of cAMP from the isolated hamster liver cells. Liver cells
were isolated from adult Syrian hamsters by the method of Seglen. The
cells were preincubated in RPMI-1640 medium for 5 hours. The release of
cAMP into the culture medium was deterrnined by radioimmunoassay.

Cyclic AMP accumulation in the medium containing porcine crystalline
glucagon was observed. At addition of 10-ii moles it was 0.73 pmole/10^6
cells/h, while at addition of 10^-8 moles it was 4.14 pmole/10^6 cells/h.
Extracted IRGs from the tumor also had elevated cAMP concentration. (In
the case of IRG3500, at addition of 2.4 x 10^-10 moles it was 2.67
pmole/10^6 cells/h, while with addition of 7.5 x 10^-10 moles it was 16.7
pmole/10^6 cells/h. ln the case of IRG9000, and addition of 0.7 x 10^-10
moles it was 0.7 pmole/10^6 cells/h, while with addition of 2.9 x 10 ^-10
moles it was 0.93 pmole/10^6 cells/h).

A similar tendency in the result of intracellular cAMP and the results
obtained from the medium. Glucagon from extracted ITC-1 tumor has
biological activity causing a quantity of glucagon release from liver
cells of hamsters, cAMP component in liver cells. The release of cAMP from
liver cells was low in animals with tumors compared with control animals.
These results suggested that the biological activity of extracted tumor
glucagon was highest in glucagon with a molecular weight of 3500. IRG of
molecular weight 3500 showed biological activity similar to that of
standard glucagon.

We established a novel megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (TS9;22) and
assessed its characteristics. TS9;22 cells carry the Ph translocation and
major-BCR rearrangement shown by Southern analysis to be those of the
original patient's sample, therefore, we identified TS9;22 cell as a
leukemic cell line. TS9;22 cells carry both myeloid (CD 13 and CD33) and
megakaryocyte/platelet antigens(CD41). Addition of interleukin(IL)?3 and
IL-6 caused increasing numbers of colony formation and proliferation, as
well as increasing number of polyploid cells with up to 12 nuclei with
mature megakaryocyte morphology. Moreover, IL-3 and IL-6 induced
expression of megakaryocyte/platelet antigen as well as demarcation
membrane and platelet-associated granule-like structure. TS9;22 also
constitutionally expressed transcription factors, GATA-1/GATA-2/SCL
expression, that were considered to be associated with
erythoid/megakaryocyte lineages. All these findings indicate that TS9;22
could be a useful cell line in determining megakaryocyte lineage
differentiation.

Methods: The gallbladder cancer cells were isolated from the primary
mastoid adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder obtained from a 61 year-old
female patient. The cancer cells were cultured in Eagle and RPMI 1640
media with fetal bovine serum.

Results: This cell line could grow steadily in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal
bovine serum and proliferate rapidly. The cells were epithelial-like and
had large nuclei with one or more nucleoli. The cells could form multi-
layered colonies. Doubling time of cell proliferation was about 48 h.
Mitotic index was high. Chromosome frequency distribution belonged to
hypotriploidy. All athymic rude mice could form the transplant tumors in
the test of subcutaneous inoculation. A plentiful of microvilli and fewer
cell junctions such as desmosomes were observed by transmission electron
microscopy. Virus granule, mycoplasma and bacteria were negative.

Conclusions: SGC-996 cells accorded with the general characteristics of the
cell line in vitro.

Cyclosporine A (CsA), an immuno-suppressive agent, has been shown to
preferentially abrogate cell-mediated immune responses, presumably by
blocking early events in T helper cell activation. T-cell suppression by
CsA has been shown to be reversed by the addition of exogenous interleukin
2 (IL-2). Although many studies have shown the cytostatic effects of CsA
on T-malignant cells, little has been done to compare the mechanisms of
suppression on malignant vs. normal T cells. We have therefore undertaken
studies on the effects of CsA on IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent tumor
cells and on T helper cell clones in order to elucidate the mechanism of
suppression by CsA.

Multiple models in vitro and in vivo of human prostatic cancer are
required for the development and preliminary testing of potential agents
for the treatment of this disease. A few human prostatic tumour cell lines
have been established in cell culture or as xenografts in athymic nude
mice, mainly from metastatic prostate tissue. A new human prostatic cell
line, TEN/12, from a primary tumour, has been serially passaged in athymic
nude mice which should prove to be a useful additional model. The tumour
displays both anaplastic and glandular regions, pleomorphic nuclei and
abundant mitoses (65/1000 cells). Heterogenous distribution of prostatic
acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen expression is seen in
sections of the xenografts. Extensive vascularization of the primary
tumour and xenografts has prompted the search for angiogenesis factor
expression in these cells. The TEN/12 xenografts appear to be androgen
sensitive as excellent growth is observed in intact males and testosterone
supplemented males but no tumours have yet been observed in females or
castrated males. Analysis of nuclear steroid hormone receptor indicated
high affinity binding with a Kd 4.1 x 10-9 M/l and a receptor content of
611 fmoles/mg DNA. Various hormonal modalities are presently being tested
using this in vivo model. The cells from the xenografts can be cultured in
semi-solid agar containing medium DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal calf
serum, insulin and 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone, so providing an in vitro
experimental model of prostatic carcinoma.

At present, not more than a few permanent human prostate cancer cell lines
have been described. The only androgen responsive in vitro cell line is
LNCaP, which exhibits an atypical hormone response pattern due to a
mutated androgen receptor. The PC-346 xenograft cell line is the only
human prostate cell line known thus far in which initial regression upon
androgen withdrawal is followed by tumor relapse, suggesting the presence
of hormone-dependent and -independent cell populations, Recently we
established in vitro cultures from the PC-346 xenograft model following
collagenase digestion of PC-346 tumor fragments from the 12th mouse
passage. After plating in Matrigel coated culture flasks with low serum
(2%) culture medium, poorly spread epithelial colonies were obtained that
could be passaged by trypsinization. Contamination by (murine) stromal
cells was no longer detectable after two passages. Currently, this new in
vitro cell line, PC-346C, is in its 20th passage. The cells express
prostate specific markers such as PSA (resulting in levels >2500 ng/ml in
culture medium) and, unlike LNCaP, also prostate-specific TGase. Hormone
responsiveness of PC-346C cells was tested in a modified MTT assay. In the
absence of steroids, little if any growth occurred. Dose-dependent
stimulation of growth was observed after addition of testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone or R1881. Even upon androgenic stimulation, however,
growth was relatively slow (doubling time 4-5 days). In contrast to LNCaP,
PC-346C cells were not stimulated by estradiol or flutamide.
Immunocytochemistry, binding assays and Western blot analysis showed the
presence of androgen receptors. Complete sequencing of exons 2 through 8
of the receptor gene demonstrated that mutations were absent in this part
of the gene. Injection of 10x10^6 PC-346C cells into male nude mice
resulted in rapidly growing tumors (doubling time 5.2 +- 1.1 days) within 30
days in 9 of 10 animals. High levels of PSA (>1000 ng/ml) were measured in
the serum of these animals. In the same experiment, no growth was detected
in females until 95 days post-inoculation. Finally, growth occurred in
2/10 female male. From these tumors, another in vitro line (PC346CF) was
established. PC-346CF cells were not stimulated by androgens in vitro.
Further characterization of this new subline and comparative studies of
PC-346C and PC-346CF cells are currently underway. By virtue of their unique
properties, PC-346C and its hormone-insensitive variant will be valuable
new models to study the mechanisms of androgen-regulated growth and gene
expression.

AB   Yes
Caki-1 cells were selected for 2'-deoxyribosyl-7-deazaadenine
(deoxytubercidin, dTub) resistance by exposure to incrementally increasing
dTub concentrations over a one-year period. The resulting cells, Caki-dTub,
were moderately resistant to dTub (5-fold). and were approximately
200-fold cross resistant to 2'-deoxyribosyl-2-chloroadenine (CldAdo). The
resistance to these two agents was stable during maintenance of the cells
in the absence of dTub. They were also cross resistant (20-fold) to the
deoxy-cytidine kinase substrates arabinosyl cytosine and gemcitahine.
Surprisingly, the Caki-dTub cells were collaterally sensitive
(approximately 20-fold) to the deoxycytidine kinase substrates, arabinosy1-
2-fluoroadenine (FaraA) and BCH-4556 [Beta-L-(-)-dioxola-necytidineJ,
suggesting that deoxycytidine kinase activity was retained in the
resistant cell line. The presence of kinase activity was confirmed by
measurement of the uptake of radiolabeled CldAdo into acid-insoluble
material of Caki-1 and Caki-dTub cells, and by measurement of kinase
activity in cell homogenates. The Caki-dTub cells were also cross
resistant to the organic cations tetraethylammonium (8-fold). cyanine 863
(11-fold), and quinidine (2.5-fold). Cytotoxic organic cations are thought
to express their carcinoma toxicity via upjake into mitochondria. A
mechanism for CldAdo action involves binding of its 5'-triphosphate
metabolite to Apaf-I that enhances cytochrome c activation of caspase-9 in
the induction of apoptosis (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95: 9567-9571,
1998). Consequently, we tested whether cytochrome c release from
mitochondria might be reduced in the Caki-dTub cells. Release of
cytochrome c induced after 16-24h incubation in 1 uM CldAdo (toxic to Caki-1
but not Caki-dTub cells) was approximately 20% of the total cytochrome
c in both cell types. Thus, either cytochrome c release is not related to
the mechanism of cell killing in these cells or perhaps more likely, the
resistant cells are impaired in their ability to induce apoptosis at a
step beyond cytochrome c release. The cross resistance to some
deoxycytidine kinase sub-strates and collateral sensitivity to FaraA and
BCH-4556 in the Caki-dTub cells is a novel phenotype of potential clinical
importance.

9 and 14 chromosome DNA probes. After comparing the hybridization pattern
with the G-banding pattern on the same metaphase, a translocation between
Nos 12 and 17 chromosomes was identified in some Francois' monkey cells,
one of chromosome No 17 was broken into two at the breakpoint 17q13, the
segment (17q13-17qter) without centromere transfered to the long arm
terminal of one chromosome No 12. Thus, two derivant chromosomes der(12)
and der(17) were formed, the long arm of der(12) was longer than the
normal partner, while the long arm of der(17) was shorter than the normal
one. The result indicated that the technique of FISH using human whole
chromosome probes was not only a powerful tool to detect human chromosome
rearrangements, but also a useful method to study the primate chromosome
aberration.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an epithelial cancer of high incidence in South
China and some African areas, is of great interest for its close
association with EB virus and for the genetic predisposition to it in some
ethnic populations. Recently an epithelial cell line CNE-2 has been
established from a poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma which
represents the first of the kind. Cytogenetic analysis of the CNE-2 line
was carried out by chromosome banding technique. It was found that the
chromosome number of the CNE-2 cells varied from 87 to 107 and the modal
number was 104-103. All cells contained a series of structurally abnormal
chromosomes and most of them were either consistent or frequently found.
Among these chromosomes there were two giant markers which, by banding
pattern analysis, proved to be different from the so-called giant A marker
previously found in many lymphoblastoid cell lines of NPC. Comparison
between CNE-2 and CNE, another epithelial cell line which was established
from well differentiated NPC indicated that while they were quite
different in many cytogenetic respects they had three chromosome markers
in common, namely, an iso 8q at (?;3q) and a small acrocentric one. With
finding of these and the giant markers mentioned above the problem whether
there exists a chromosome marker specific for NPC was discussed.

The simple repetitive DNA of SME-1 cells at different passages was
detected by fluorescein labelled probe LZF-1. From the DNA fingerprints,
some results could be concluded: when the passage rised, the probability
of bands sharing, the maximum allelic frequency and the similarity
coefficient decreased between cells at the same passage and at the
different passage, while the mutation rate increased as variation of cells
strengthened. Therefore, to analyse the genetic variation of SME-1 cell line
by DNA fingerprinting was feasible. This paper seems to provide a good
detective method and genetical markers for clone culture of SME-1 cells,
and also provide a molecular basis for study of SME-1 cell line in cell
biology.

The rat cell line 3Y1 (Kimura et al., 1975) has many characteristics of
normal fibroblastic cells; it has the diploid karyotype (Yamashita et al.,
1980), a high requirement for serum (Kimura, 1975; Kimura and Itagaki,
1975), and high sensitivity to density-dependent inhibition of
proliferation (Kimura et al., 1975; Okuda and Kimura, 1978). 3Y1 cells
have been useful in the study of proliferation control in cell culture
(Okuda and Kimura, 1978, 1982, and 1983; Okuda et al., 1983; Ohno et al.,
1984), in transformation experiments with a variety of viral agents
(Kimura et al., 1975; Hama and Kimura, 1978; Ishibashi et al., 1980;
Kawai, 1980; Ohno and Kimura, 1984) and a chemical carcinogen (Sandmeyer
et al., 1981), and in somatic cell genetics (Ohno et al., 1984). Sublines
of 3Y1 deficient in thymidine kinase (ATP: thymidine 5'-
phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.75; TK) should be useful in gene-transfer

The mouse macrophage cell line A640-BB-2 was cytotoxic against newborn
larvae (NBL) of Trichinella spiralis after activation by
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activated macrophages developed ridge-like
processes and spread more extensively on culture substrates than untreated
control cells. NBL that were cultured with activated, LPS-stimulated
macrophages for 72 h became inactive or were killed. These results
indicate that activated macrophages may play an important role in defence
against infection with Trichinella spiralis.

Cultivated cells as a substrate for virus replication are now an important
basis for a wide variety of experiments with viruses and for the problems
associated with them. Depending on the objective of the experiment and
other circumstances, either primary cultures are used for this purpose, i.
e. cultures established with cells freshly isolated from organs, or
cultures of passaged cell strains. As will be explained later, cell strain
cultures offer a number of fundamental advantages over freshly grown
cultures. However, our experience of handling cell strains, especially of
the changes that cultures can experience in the course of long-term
passages in vitro and their causes, is still incomplete. The following
description of a three-year-old cell strain from pig kidneys is therefore
intended as a contribution to clarifying these questions. Some authors
have already reported on attempts to keep cultures from pig kidneys in
continuous passages. However, details on the characteristics of their
strains or their behavior towards the foot-and-mouth disease virus have
not yet been published. Because of the practical importance of cultivating
this virus in kidney cell cultures, the behavior of the cell strain
obtained in relation to the FMDV virus is discussed in detail.

Objective: To establish an etoposide-resistant human small cell lung
cancer cell line H446/VP and study its biological characteristics.

Methods: H446/VP cell line was obtained by exposing at intervals and
repeatedly to high dose of etoposide for 7 months. The morphological
feature, ultrastructure and growth characters were examined. Flow cytometry
was used to evaluate the cell cycle distribution of H446/VP and its
parental cell line. MTT assay was used to measure the cross-resistant
profile of H446/VP cells.

Results: Under light microscope, H446/VP cells was similar with H446 cells
stained by hematoxylin and eosin. While observed by transmission electron
microscope, there were more malformed nuclei, abundant mitochondria,
ribosomes and endoplasmic reticular in H446/VP cells. H446/VP cells grew
more slowly than H446 cells and their population doubling time was 35.7
hours which was 7.9 hours longer than H446 cell line. Cell cycle
distribution of H446/VP cells has changed compared with parental cells.
The percentage of cells in Go/G, phase increased to 65.12 +- 1.67% , while
the percentage of cells in G2/M phase decreased to 3.99 +- 1.49%. The
resistance index of H446/VP cells to etoposide was 17.8 and the cells
showed various cross-resistance to ADR, NVT, VCR, MMC and CDDP, the
resistance indexes were 8.9, 5.4, 4.7, 4.4 and 1.7, respectively. The
cells remain sensitive to 5-Fu, MTX, CTX, and so on.

Conclusion: A multidrug resistance cell line H446/VP from human small cell
lung cancer is established. It can be used for further experiments.

cells, spindal like cells also exist. The chromosome number is 2n=6, The
observation with electron microscope showed no contamination of virus or
mycoplasma. The dynamic study of amino acids requirement indicated that
the cells consumed relatively large amount of Glu, Tyr, Orn, Arg, Cys,
etc., but increased the concentration of Asp in the medium. The activity
of carboxylesterase and cholinesterase were detected. Esterase zymograms
from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed 3 bands. The Anopheles

Objective: To establish a carboplatin-resistance human retinoblastoma cell
line SO-Rb50/CBP and study its biological characteristics and the probable
drug-resistance mechanism.

Methods: First, SO-Rb50/CBP was induced by intermittently administration
of high-concentration of carboplatin (CBP). Then MTT assay was used to
detect drug sensitivity of the two cell lines. Then reverse transcripts
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect the
transcription of MRP and GST-pi genes in cells of SO-Rb50 and SO-Rb50/CBP
respectively. Immunohistochemical technique and flow cytometry were used
to detect the proteins of MRP and GST-pi of the above cells.

Results: The drug-resistance index of SO-Rb50/CBP cell line to CBP was 15.7.
The population doubling time of SO-Rb50 and SO-Rb50/CBP were 44.32 h
and 50.9 h respectively. The drug-resistance indices of SO-Rb50/CBP to DDP,
VCR, MMC, VP-16 and 5-FU were 6.89, 5.68, 4.58, 2.28 and 1.88 respectively.
The positive rate of GST-pi and MRP in SO-Rb50/CBP cells were 96.19% and
90.21% respectively by immunocytochemistry, while in SO-Rb50 cells were
20.12% and 30.48% respectively. The mRNA level of MRP and GST-pi were higher
in SO-Rb50/CBP cells than that in SO-Rb50 cells.

Conclusions: The established carboplatin-resistance human retinoblastoma
cell line SO-Rb50/CBP showed resistance to several other drugs such as
MMC, DDP, VCR, VP-16. The drug-resistance mechanism of SO-Rb50/CBP cells
maybe due to high expression of MRP and GST-pi genes.

nitrogen and they could be restarted in tissue culture. They exhibit
stable growth with doubling time of 34 hours and are free of mycoplasma
contamination. These cells appear epithelial in shape, showing no visible
contact region and multilayering growth. Some cells are multinucleated,

the mode of 42, which was a typical neoplastic feature. The tumorigenicity
of CC-VGH-7-T is now tested in athymic nude mice. Two out of three athymic
mice which were inoculated with cultured cells developed tumors in 4 weeks.
Interestingly, these cells do not form colony by soft agar test.

A human glioblastoma multiforme cell line has been established from a
glioma on the frontal lobe of a senior man. This cell line was designated
BT 325 and has been maintained in culture for over four years. The
morphologic features of cells are variable. Globose, bipolar, stellate and
multinuclear giant cells have been observed from the culture. Doubling
time calculated from the growth curve was approximately 36.5 hours. The
karyotype was shown hypo-tetraploid and had one marker chromosome in most
cells. Cell cycle phase and relative DNA content in cells were measured
from 9th to 57th passage by FCM and PLM. Cells inoculated into nude mice
subcutaneously grew into tumors similar to the original tumour
histologically. Microtubules and bundles of filaments can be observed by
electron microscope. Cells are positively stained by antiserum to GFAP.
Results of PTAH stain and Foot's stain proved these cells are malignant
glioma in no time. The rate of vitality of those frozen cells around 77%
showed the growth and character of the cell line was stable. It was
helpful in selection of anti glioma chemotherapy.

To investigate the cellular biological charateristics of bile duct
carcinoma, the first cell line of extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma, named
as QBC939, was established in China. The cell line was histologically
similar to the originai tumor. Electron microscopic studies indicated the
presence of characteristic junctions between cells, microvilli on the cell
surface, microfilaments and microtube in cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry
of cultured cells and reconstituted tumor in nude mouse showed that the
cell line was strongly positive for karatin and desmosome, supporting the
epilhelial origin of the cell line. The study of growth kinetics
demonstrated that the QBC939 cell line grew fast with independent and
higher viability. The cytogenetic study revealed that the abnormality in
number and structure, such as fracture, transplantation, loss and insert
of chromosomes, presented in the cell line. Soft sepharose culture and
nude mouse xenografts indicated that this cell line was strungly
tumorigenic.

Objective: To establish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and
provide more pure liver carcinoma cells for HCC studies.

Methods: The carcinoma tissues were obtained from the primary lesion and
metastatic lesion in portal vein of HCC. The carcinoma cells were isolated
by Percoll density gradient centrifuge and cultivated. The cell clones
were then obtained by micro-environmental digestion and cell lines were
established. The growth curves, G band chromosome karyotype, comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) of the established cells were characterized.
The cells were implanted in nude mice for tumorigenesis.

Results: 20 cases of HCC cells were isolated and cultivated. Two cell
lines (designated as H2M and H4M) were successfully established from 2
cases of emboli of portal vein. The karyotype showed that both cell lines
are a hypertriploid (71~78 chromosomes). A marker chromosome containing 1q
and 6p [t(1;6)] was found in H2M cells and a huge marker chromosome
containing a long homogeneously staining region (hsr) in H4M cells. The
main genetic alterations analyzed by CGH were a high copy number
amplification of 1q, 3q, 5p, 6p, 7q and 8q and loss of 4q, 13q, 16q, 17p
and 19p in H2M cells, whereas, amplification of 6p, 7p, 11p, 11q13 and
loss of 8p, 9, 13q, 16q in H4M cells. Implantation of H2M cells in nude
mice for a month produces typical human hepatocellular carcinoma, but no
tumor for H4M cells.

Conclusions: Percoll density gradient centrifuge and micro-environmental
digestion is an effective method for cloning of primary carcinoma cell and
cell line establishment. Two established HCC cell lines will provide
culture cells for HCC studies. The genetic alterations detected in both
cell lines also provide clues and cell models for further screening of
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in HCC.

Fibroblast-like cells obtained from explant culture of an one-day-old fry

approximately 1.5 days at 27 Celsius for 540 days when the cells attained
252 Population Doubling Number (PDN) and the serial passage was stopped.
No symptom of crisis was encountered during the passage. At several PDNs,
changes in various biological parameters were examined. The growth
characteristics of the cells strongly indicated that this PF line, like
some other cell lines of fish, appears to have unlimited proliferating
potentials without any apparent sign of being malignantly transformed, and
hence to have been immortalized without transformation. During
subcultivation, the cloning efficiencies considerably fluctuated between
approx. 1 to 20%. Although the number of chromosomes was the same (46) at
12, 75, and 175 PDNs, all of the 46 chromosomes were acrocentric at 12 PDN
while 45 acrocentric and 1 submetacentric chromosomes were found at 75 and
175 PDNs. The saturation cell density ranged from 6.8 to 12x10^4
cells/cm^2 during passage and the contact inhibition of growth generally
worked well. The cells were highly proficient in photoreactivation of
UV-induced cell killing as well as DNA damage in terms of UV-specific
endonuclease sensitive sites. The potential usefulness of this cell line
for study of relationships between DNA damage and carcinogenesis was

For study of immunoglobulin production in genetically identical cells, we
have developed a technique for cloning normal human lymphocytes in vitro
and modified the conventional methods for establishing lymphocytoid cell
lines. Our technique of cloning lymphocytes is the first method yet
described in the literature for obtaining lymphocyte clones, in a pure
sense, since this technique enables us to observe the fate of single,
isolated lymphocytes under the inverted microscope. The modified method
for the establishment of lymphocyte cell lines solved the most difficult
problem of conventional methods (i.e., the requirement of a large quantity
of blood) so that cell lines can be derived from virtually any individual,
including pediatric patients.

To clone lymphocytes, cell suspensions were diluted to a final
concentration of 1 cell per 10 microliters and plated out in microwells of
(Falcon) plastic microtest plates. These were then incubated at 37
Celsius, in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, with sequential observation
under the inverted microscope. Initial experiments on phytohemagglutinin-
stimulated lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of normal persons
demonstrated that 9% of the single cells formed microcolonies of 30-100
cells after 10 days using medium in which HeLa cells have been grown.
However, when the peripheral blood lymphocytes were first established as
continuously growing cell lines, up to 50% of the single cells produced
clones of 100 or more cells, which were then selectively propagated as
sublines.

For establishment of the lymphocytoid cell lines, the buffy coat
cells of 10 ml of heparinized venous blood were cultured in RPMI medium
1640 with 20% fetal calf serum. At the initiation of the culture either
small amounts of intact cells or cell lysates from previously established
lymphocytoid cell lines were added as the "stimulating" agents. The cell
lines chosen for stimulation had sex chromosome complements which were
different from those of the donors.

When 13 cultures were set up from 5 different donors by using
intact cells from previously established cell lines, 3 new cell lines
were established from 2 donors. When cell lysates were used, however, in
36 cultures from 16 donors, 14 cell lines were developed (from 9 individuals) at the end of 10 weeks of culture. These included 2 cell lines
from a patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. These 2 cell lines are
deficient in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase activity and
are the first reported, biochemically marked human lymphocytoid cell lines.
The modal chromosome number and the karyotype of each of the 17
new lymphocytoid cell lines were the same as those of the donor's cells.
Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoretic studies revealed the production
of immunoglobulins of various classes and types in 15 of these 17 new
cell lines.

Two cell lines, UM-1 and UM-5, which were derived from two healthy male
donors and established by our modified method, were cloned by our
technique to yield 8 and 7 clonal sublines, respectively. The parental
lines were found to produce consistently IgG and IgM of the kappa type,
and all of the cloned sublines of both lymphocytoid cell lines produced
the same classes and the same type of immunoglobulins as the parental cell
lines. This suggests that each lymphocytoid cell of these two cell lines
produces both IgG and IgM at the same time.

Genetic studies of higher organisms, including man, are based on the
analysis of segregation and recombination events resulting from sexual
reproduction. In 1962 Pontecorvo predicted, however, that cultured cells
could also be employed for this purpose. He suggested that parasexual
events, detected in certain fungi, might occur also in in vitro cultured
cells. Now, ten years later, there are strong indications that this
prediction will indeed come true.

The properties and potential applications of human lymphoblastoid cell
lines have been investigated. Such lines have been established by others
from Burkitt's lymphoma tissue, from leukaemic patients, from those with
infectious mononucleosis and latterly from healthy subjects. There is an
association between EB virus (Herpes-like virus of Epstein and Barr) and
the growth of human lymphoblastoid cell lines in vitro. The sane virus is
linked sero-epidemiologically with Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, infectious mononucleosis and a number of other diseases of man.
The exact role of the virus both in vivo and in vitro is a matter of some
controversy. Using a simple culture technique, 40 cell lines were
established from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a diagnostically
mixed group of patients, from normal cord blood and from one healthy
adult. 25 of these cultures were initiated by adding EB virus (in the form
of lethally irradiated cells of a virus-positive line) to the fresh blood
leukocytes. Evidence from experiments of this type suggest that EB virus
has a lymphoproliferative action in vitro.

The cell lines are morphologically almost indistinguishable. They resemble
primitive cells of the lymphoid series and appear to have the property of
indefinite growth in vitro. They include some phagocytic cells and
imunoglobulins are released into the culture medium. Few of the lines
were chromosomally abnormal when examined shortly after establishment but
all of those examined after more than 1 year of continuous growth had
abnormal karyotypes. There vas no evidence for the recurrence of any
specific chromosome aberration in a significant proportion of the lines.

Antigenically the established lines differ from the original donor's fresh
lymphocytes. This is shown by measurement of tritiated thymidine uptake by
lymphocytes exposed in vitro to irradiated cells from an autochthonous
line. Together with the activation process, the fresh lymphocytes acquire
cytotoxic potential directed specifically against the cell line used in
the activation phase. It is suggested that this system constitutes a model
for an immunological surveillance mechanism operating in vivo to eliminate
deviant cells. Cell lines of this type offer ecope for detailed
investigation of the induction of proliferation in human tissue (in this
case probably by EB virus) and of the immunological processes by which
altered autochthonous cells may be recognised and destroyed. Both of these
topics a relevant to the basic study of malignant disease. The prolonged
life span and relative stability of these lines in vitro also presents
opportunities in the field of human genetics, both for the investigation of
inherited disorders of man and, experimentally, for the measurement of
spontaneous and induced mutation rates, analysis of gene linkage and
chromosome mapping.

Injection of channel catfish with HPV protected these fish from subsequent

and CHSE 214 (chinook salmon), CSE 119 (coho salmon), SSE 5 (sockeye
salmon), STE 137 (steelhead trout) and RTH 149 (rainbow trout), were
partially characterized. Mycoplasmas were not detected in any of the cell
lines. All cell lines exhibited heteroploidy. The CHSE 114, CHSE 214, and
SSE 5 cell lines had hypodiploid modal chromosome numbers of 63, 67, and
64, respectively. The STE 137 and RTH 149 cell lines had hyperdiploid
modal numbers of 66 and 64, respectively. The CSE 119 cell line had a
hypotetraploid modal number of 110. The same modal number (67) was found
at both transfer levels tested, 113 and 308, for CHSE 214 cell line. This
indicated that the modal number for this cell line was no longer changing.
Saturation density and optimum growth cell density were determined for all
cell lines except CHSE 114. Saturation densities of cell lines ranged from
1.7 X 10^6 (RTH 149) to 6.2 X 10^6 (STE 137) cells per 35X10 mm dish. An
optimum growth cell density of 2.3 X 10^4, 5.0 X 10^4, and 1.4 X 10^4 cells
per 35X10 mm dish was obtained for CHSE 214 (transfer level 100's), CSE
119, and STE 137 cell lines, respectively (t test, alpha .05). No differences
in cell growth rates were found for other cell lines at densities tested
(t test, alpha .05). Optimum growth temperature was determined for CHSE 214
and STE 137 cell lines grown at 8, 12, 16, 23, 27, and 34 Celsius (t test,
alpha .05). The CHSE 214 cell line exhibited exponential growth at 12, 16, and
23 Celsius. The STE 137 cell line exhibited exponential growth at 12 and 16
Celsius. Optimum growth temperatures for CHSE 214 cell line occurred at 16 and
23 Celsius. No difference (alpha .05) between growth rates at 12 and 16 Celsius
was found for STE 137 cell line. Maintenance growth occurred at 8 and 27 Celsius
for CHSE 214 cell line, and at 8, 23, and 27 Celsius for STE 137 cell line.
Neither cell line grew at 34 Celsius. No cells adhered to dishes after 72 h
incubation at this temperature. Using a plaque assay technique, CHSE 114,
CHSE 214, SSE 5, STE 137, and RTH 149 cell lines were susceptible to IHNV and
IPNV. The CSE 119 cell line was found to be unsuitable for use in plaque assays.
Both control and virus-infected CSE 119 cell monolayers developed plaques
similar to those produced by viruses. Attempts at cloning CHSE 214, CSE 119,
STE 137, and RTH 149 cell lines were futile. Cells would not grow at
low densities required for cloning.

Collagen production by skin fibroblast cell strains from normal subjects
and age-matched patients with the mendelian disorder -- Osteogenesis
Imperfecta (OI) -- was studied in culture. Number of generations in culture,
phase of growth, labelling times, and site of biopsy did not influence
collagen production by normal skin fibroblasts. OI cell strains from
patients with dominantly inherited OI have abnormal morphology and growth
in culture. The ratio of type I to protype III collagen is reduced in OI
types I, II and IV (Sillence classification). Type III OI could not be
distinguished from normal strains by the analysis used. From the collagen
phenotype (biochemical parameters) we were able to distinguish different
OI phenotypes and to correlate these with clinical phenotypes. One form of
OI type I produces an unstable collagen that is degraded to small peptides
in culture.

This thesis records the results of a series of experiments that were
designed to examine the biology of human malignant melanoma cells cultured
in vitro. The studies were so planned as to document phenotypic
differences that exist between melanomas, to define respects in which
melanoma cell differentiation could be modulated and to correlate
biochemical variability with in vivo behaviour as measured in the nude
mouse. Melanoma cell lines were established from biopsy material obtained
from 7 patients at Groote Schuur Hospital. Two of these lines synthesized
tyrosinase and melanin at a rate that was directly related to cell density.
The five remaining lines did not pigment. All of the lines showed
aneuploidy; 5 of the 7 showed anchorage-independent growth; and 6 of the 7
grew as lethal tumours in nude mice. As has been found with all other
melanomas studied, these cells released a plasminogen activator that was
chemically and immunologically identical to tissue activator. One of the
lines proved to be an exception to this general rule in that it
synthesized urokinase-type enzyme. Unlike most other human cells cultured
in vitro, melanoma cells proved to be relatively refractory to hormonal
stimuli. Addition of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, dexamethasone
or melanocyte-stimulating hormone to the culture medium had very little
effect on cellular release of plasminogen activator, upon cell growth, or
upon cellular morphology. Although remarkably resistant to hormonal
influences, cellular release of plasminogen activator did appear to be
inhibited to a striking degree by cocultivation with normal skin
fibroblasts. This observation led to the discovery of a phenomenon in
which fibroblasts of many types bound tissue-type plasminogen activator
and so removed it from the medium. This was accompanied by an apparent
change in molecular weight of the melanoma cell enzyme from 72K daltons to
approximately 115K daltons, suggesting the presence of a 40-50K binding
molecule. In an attempt to influence in vitro differentiation, the tumour
promoter tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, and the differentiation-inducing
retinoid, retinoic acid, were added to the two pigmenting cell lines. The
effects of these compounds on induction of tyrosinase activity,
morphological change or plasminogen activator release differed. In the one
cell line, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate caused morphological maturation
with a decrease in the rate of plasminogen activator release and no
obvious effect upon pigmentation. This line was relatively resistant to
the action of retinoids. The other pigmenting line responded hardly at all
to the tumour promoter. Retinoic acid, on the other hand, inhibited the
induction of tyrosinase activity, yet caused an inhibition of growth and
plasminogen activator release. A number of interesting observations could
be made in experiments in which melanoma cells were inoculated into nude
mice. Firstly, the growth rate of the tumours in vivo correlated poorly
with the doubling times of the corresponding cells cultured in vitro.
Secondly, despite a marked inhibitory effect of fibroblasts on plasminogen
activator in vitro, coinjection of fibroblasts and melanoma cells in vivo
greatly enhanced tumour growth when small tumour cell inocula were used
and shortened the latent period for tumour appearance with larger inocula.
Thirdly, melanomas growing in nude mice differed strikingly in their
ability to elicit a desmoplastic response. Tumours in which large amounts
of host connective tissue were deposited tended to be heavily contaminated
with murine fibroblasts when re-established in vitro. This contamination
was not seen with tumours that contained very little connective tissue.
These results point to the existence of a melanoma-associated fibrogenic
factor. Finally, by excision of the primary tumour, it was possible to
avoid death of the animal from local complications and so allow time for
metastases to develop. In three mice, metastatic melanoma deposits could
be detected by this device, so establishing a protocol for the use of nude
mice as valid models for the experimental study of metastatic spread of
human tumours.

Cytogenetic studies were performed on an established cell line, OK,
derived from the kidney tissue of Didelphys virginiana, the North American
opossum (2n = 24). This line was shown to have a modal number of 23, and a
considerable degree of aneuploidy. Karyotypes exhibited 11 sets of
pairable chromosomes and one nearly metacentric, marker chromosome.
Studies on fluorescent stained interphase cells revealed the sex chromatin
body. The presence of 2 condensed bodies frequently seen in this study
supports the idea that there is no typical inactivation of one entire X
chromosome in the opossum and may represent another method of dosage
compensation in marsupials. The C-banding pattern revealed the exclusive
localization of constitutive heterochromatin within the sex chromosomes.
G-banding patterns enabled clear identification of all of the OK chromosomes.
The large, nearly metacentric, marker chromosome is shown to be the result
of the fusion of two telocentric chromosomes. Q-banding methods, while
producing some degree of longitudinal differentiation in the chromosomes,
did not give totally satisfactory results. Spontaneous SCE frequencies of
the OK chromosome is quite similar to the frequency of induced SCEs as a
result of exposure to 4 alkylating agents, (EMS, MMS, ENU, and MNU),
increased with increasing dose for all agents tested. The methyl
derivative of the alkane sulfonates and the methyl derivative of the
nitrosamides were more potent inducers of SCEs than their ethyl analogs.

Mos. 55; Anopheles stephensi, Mos. 43; Culex quinquefasciatus. All insect
cell lines exhibited most of the characteristics associated with
transformed or neoplastic cells. Distinct "spontaneous" SCE frequencies
reflecting phylogenetic relationships were observed among three mosquito
species from two genera. The clastogens BrdU, EMS, MMS, ENU, and MNU were
found to induce SCEs and the differences in the number of exchanges
between insect and mammalian cells after compensating for genome sizes,
reflect either their differential susceptibility to the damage initially
inflicted to the DNA or to their capacities to perform DNA repair. By
comparing the rate of SCE increase in the insect and mammalian cells, it
was concluded that dissimilarities in number of SCEs between these two
groups of organisms is more likely due to differences in their repair
mechanism(s) in the case of BrdU and to the degree of initial DNA damage
in the case of the alkylating agents. An in vitro assay system designed
to test potential mutagens/carcinogens in fresh water is proposed using
mosquito cell lines of larval origin. The advantages of such a system are
discussed. Electrophoretic characterization of eleven insect cell lines
was performed utilizing 24 enzyme systems. Positive identification of all
cultures was possible. A positive correlation was found between number of
isozymes, enzyme activity and metabolic importance of the enzyme system.
The electrophoretic data revealed that Anopheles gambiae (Mos. 55) and the
Culex quinquefasciatus cell lines are in fact the same cell line.
Similarly, the Aedes pseudoscutellaris (Mos. 61) cell line was found to be
Aedes albopictus (C6/36). Biochemical differences were noticed between
cells growing in an insect medium and cultures maintained in a mammalian
medium. The superiority of slab polyacrylamide electrophoresis over starch
gel, agar gel and cellulose acetate electrophoresis in visualizing insect

A system was developed to study membrane transport in isolated human
fibroblast plasma membrane vesicles, avoiding potential complications of
intracellular binding and metabolism in the intact cell. Ten-fold
enrichment of plasma membranes after subcellular fractionation was
confirmed with appropriate markers. Transport competence was established
by the following criteria: osmotic sensitivity, stereospecificity,
temperature dependence, sodium gradient stimulation, response to ions and
ionophores, saturability, and exchange properties. Methotrexate uptake was
osmotically sensitive, temperature sensitive, saturable, and inhibited by
folinic acid and phosphate. Measurement of lysine uptake was complicated
by binding and lack of sodium dependence, but was stimulated by an
interior-negative membrane potential, and intravesicular lysine or
arginine. Exchange properties of the lysine carrier were exploited to
assess its function in fibroblasts from patients with the Mendelian
phenotype, lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI). LPI vesicles were not
different from controls in their lysine transport phenotype.

This thesis records the results of a series of experiments on the kinetics
of growth of 7 human malignant melanomas in nude mice, with particular
reference to factors in the host "milieu" that modulate proliferation,
metastasis and phenotypic expression of the tumours. Melanoma cell lines
were established in vitro, from biopsy material obtained from 7 patients
with metastatic malignant melanoma. Two of these lines synthesized
tyrosinase and melanin at a rate that was directly related to cell density.
The five remaining lines did not pigment in vitro. With the exception of
one line they all gave rise to tumours when inoculated subcutaneously into
nude mice. All 7 lines were aneuploid and 5 of the lines showed anchorage-
independent growth in vitro. The growth rate and latency period of these
human melanoma cell lines has been studied in nude mice as a function of
inoculum size. Considerable variation was observed and growth rate in vivo
correlated poorly with the doubling times of the corresponding cells
cultured in vitro. Passage through nude mice had no effect on in vitro
phenotypic characteristics of cell lines. In spite of prolonged in vitro
passage, in a number of instances the histological appearances of the mice
tumours were very similar to those seen in the original patient.
Coinjection of either adult or juvenile skin fibroblasts with
subtumorigenic doses of melanoma cells promoted the growth of tumours that
would otherwise not have formed. One of the melanoma cell lines grew
rapidly in a male host at an inoculum level that did not give rise to
tumours in the female mouse, showing that hormonal influences in the host
have a definitive effect on the growth of some melanomas in vivo.
Castrated male mice also failed to support the growth of this melanoma
cell line. Addition of estrogen and dihydrotestosterone pellets to the
castrated and ovariectomised mice proved in certain cases to be effective
stimulants of tumour growth. By excising the primary tumour before it
reached a size which was lethal to the host, metastases were made evident
in a number of instances, Two of the six melanoma cell lines showed
metastatic melanoma deposits in 100% of the animals inoculated. This
occurred within 12 weeks of removal of the primary tumour. In one of the
two cell lines metastatic spread was directly related to the size of the
primary tumour. One of the cells lines, UCR-Mel 7 elicited an intense
desmoplastic response in the host and the tumours were heavily infiltrated
with host macrophages and fibroblasts. This cell line had a most unusual
behaviour pattern in the mouse as it grew exponentially for a fairly brief
period after which a plateaux phase occurred during which no growth took
place. This was followed by a phase of regression and then a prolonged
period of dormancy after which a rapid exponential growth phase followed.
Tumours transplanted to new mice during this latter phase gave rise to
rapidly growing neoplasms which were lethal to their hosts.

Eighteen monoclonal anti-fluorescein (Fl) antibodies from BALB/cV mice
were characterized and 13 possessed a low affinity for Fl (Ka = 5 x 10^4
M^-1) while 5 had a higher affinity (Ka = 5 x 10^8 M^-1). Eleven of the 13
low affinity clones were idiotypically cross-reactive (40-100%) and 4 of
these clones possessed identical idiotypes (Ids) (3-12, 3-13, 3-17 and 3-35).
Heavy and light chains derived from clones 3-12, 3-13 and 3-17 and
used in recombination experiments, resulted in the reformation of an anti-
Fl active site in all six heterologous combinations. The expression of Ids
3-13 and 3-17 in the Io, IIo or IIIo polyclonal anti-Fl response was
quantitated and found to represent <1.0% of the specific repertoire. Ids
3-13 and 3-17 were expressed in 15/22 ad 22/28 individual mice, respectively.
Clones 3-13 and 3-17 had similar though not identical active sites as
determined by fine specificity of binding and Id inhibitions. Ids 3-13 and
3-17 represent the first demonstration of repertoire-specific recurrent
Ids expressed during a T-dependent immune response lacking a dominant Id.
Antibodies 3-13 and 3-17 were idiotypically cross-reactive (10-40%) with 6
other anti-Fl clones (designated the 9-40 family) which possessed a higher
affinity for Fl (Ka = 5 x 10^6 M^-1). Members of the 9-40 family were also
idiotypically cross-reactive with a single high affinity clone 4-4 (Ka = 5
x 10^9 M^-1). This idiotypic linkage provided a greater span in affinity
(>20,000 fold) than in all previously characterized Id families within
restricted or unrestricted immune responses. The sequence of antibody 3-13
V(H) region was determined by genomic cloning and amino acid sequencing
and was 78% homologous to the (alpha)-1,3-dextran binding myeloma proteins
J558 and 104E. Rearrangement of a V(H) gene homologous to 3-13 was
required idiotypically cross-reactive clones and in no idiotypically
distinct clones.

Prolidase deficiency (MIM 26413), an autosomal recessive phenotype, is
caused by rare alleles at a locus on chromosome 19cent-q13.2. The clinical
phenotype is pleiotropic (affecting skin, brain, etc.) and of variable
expressivity (benign to early death). I established skin fibroblast
cultures from 6 homozygous probands and 6 obligate heterozygotes, purified
prolidase (E.C. 3.4.13.9, a homodimer) from normal human fibroblasts,
raised a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the subunit, and studied its
biosynthesis. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the
subunit is synthesized in the cytosol as a 58 KDa. polypeptide and not
processed further. Homozygous prolidase-deficient cell strains expressed 3
classes of mutant alleles which by complementation analysis mapped to one
locus. The alleles were designated CRM-(nul), CRM+ activity/size variant,
and CRM+ activity variant. Heterozygotes carrying CRM- alleles have heat
stable prolidase (50 Celsius, 1hr); heterozygotes carrying CRM+ variant
alleles have heat labile enzyme. The finding implies that variant CRM+
allele(s) can confer negative allelic complementation on the dimeric
enzyme (dominant relative phenotype). CRM- homozygous cells contain varying
amounts of an alternative imidodipeptidase-like activity. The variant
prolidase allele (major gene) and amount of alternative "prolidase"
activity (modifier gene) are apparently both determinants of the
associated clinical phenotype in prolidase deficiency. I obtained and
sequenced a tryptic peptide from human kidney prolidase for synthesis of
oligonucleotide probes in the future.

How cells undergo differentiation to form unique cell types within
multicellular organisms is one of the many intriguing questions in cell
biology today. A large area of research has been devoted to determining
factors which affect growth and differentiation of cells, including the
understanding of embryonic development and the mechanism of replenishment
of damaged tissue, and identifying factors which contribute to the lack of
control of growth and differentiation in cancer.

Cell lines which retain the capacity to differentiate in culture, such as
the L6 myoblast cell line are extremely useful in these studies. The
selection of genetic mutants, which are unable to differentiate, allows
direct comparison of the phenotype with the wild type to determine the
effects of alterations in biochemistry on the differentiation process.

Undoubtedly, the plasma membrane plays a large role in cellular
differentiation. Cell surface membrane receptors interact with
extracellular components such as growth factors and other hormones which
initiate cellular differentiation, but in some types of cellular
differentiation, such as the fusion of L6 myoblasts, the plasma membranes
are more intimately involved. Several studies have indicated a requirement
for N-linked glycosylation during myoblast fusion and there is
considerable evidence from the characterization of con A-resistant mutants
to suggest that high mannose oligosaccharides are essential for L6
myoblast fusion to occur.

Clonal cell lines were isolated from mammary gland tissue epithelial cell
cultures of lactating cows. Early passage clonal bovine mammary epithelial
cells (clone LMH17) gave rise to several established cell lines (MAC-T
lines) after being cotransfected with plasmids containing the temperature
sensitive mutant SV40 large T antigen gene (pBAPSV40TtsA58) and the
bacterial phosphotransferase gene (pSV2-neo). Unlike other cell types
which were transformed after being transfected with SV40, MAC-T cells
maintained many characteristics of non-transformed cells: MAC-T cells were
serum and anchorage dependent, showed contact inhibition, and were not
tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice. However, Southern transfer analysis
revealed an integrated SV40 gene and cells showed no senescence after 50
passages. These cells are morphologically indistinguishable from parental
LMH17 cells and retain the typical morphology of mammary epithelial cells.
Positive cytokeratin immunostaining and the absence of vimentin staining
indicated that these cells were epithelial in origin. MAC-T cells grew
rapidly on plastic substratum with a doubling time of approximately 17
hours and became differentiated when grown on floating collagen gels in
the presence of prolactin. The differentiated phenotype was characterized
to include (1) the ability to form secretory domes with a lumen from a
pavement of columnar cells; (2) increased casein mRNA abundance; (3)
increased alpha S and beta casein secretion; (4) increased number and size
of casein secretory vesicles; and (5) increased lactose synthesis and
secretion.

Prolidase deficiency (McKusick 26413) is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder charaeterized by iminodipeptiduria, skin lesions and mental
retardation. The enzyme prolidase hydrolyzes dipeptides containing
C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline. The results presented here indicate
that prolidase plays a major role in the recycling of dipeptide bound
proline. Control fibroblasts were able to use iminodipeptides in lieu of
proline to sustain nonnal growth and protein synthesis whereas prolidase
deficient cells were not. Iminodipeptides added to the media of control
and mutant cells showed no adverse effeets on protein synthesis or cell
growth. These results are consistent with a mechanism of biochemical
pathology in which proline deprivation caused by the enzyme deficit is
the cause of damage to skin cells. Prolidase regulation by product and
substrate was studied. A two fold decrease of prolidase activity was
observed in fibroblasts grown in excess proline. However, cells grown in
medium in which iminodipeptides replaced proline showed no significant
difference in prolidase activity.

Three aspects of the production and applications of monoclonal antibodies
(mabs) were investigated. Two new cell lines (C23/11 and HET-37) were
produced for use as potential fusion partners in human mab production.
C23/11 was established from a blood sample obtained from a patient with
myeloma. It was shown to have many of the cellular and antigenic
properties associated with a lymphoblastoid cell line. HET-37 is a
human/murine heteromyeloma cell line which was established after C23/11
cells were fused with murine NSO cells. Both C23/11 and HET-37 were
characterised using electron microscopy, histology, immunophenotyping,
isoenzyme analysis and DNA fingerprinting. In the second experimental
section, three mab (HMFG-1, AUA-1 and H17E2) were labelled with the
radioactive isotope, Indium-III. They were used for localisation of tumour
in 21 patients with suspected ovarian carcinoma. (III)In-mab
immunoscintigraphy was found to be a more sensitive technique for
evaluation ovarian cancer than X-ray, CAT scan and ultrasound. (III)In-mab
immunoscintigraphy was particularly useful in localising tumours in
patients with serum CA-125 levels greater than 100 IU/ml. F(ab')2
fragments of HMFG-1 were labelled with technetium and were used to
determine the distribution of ovarian tumour in a patient with minimal
residual disease. In the final experimental section, HMFG-1 was chemically
conjugated to the photosensitiser hematoporphyrin, Hp. HMFG-1-Hp was shown
to kill antigen-bearing MCF-7 cells in vitro after irradiation. The
HMFG-1-Hp conjugate had no effect on EJ-138 cells under identical conditions. The
EJ-138 cell line does not express the antigen to which the HMFG-1 antibody
binds.

The present study describes the first cell lines produced from members of
class Chondrichthyes. Explants of brain tissue from Carcharhinus
falciformis (silky shark) and Ginglymostoma cirratum (nurse shark) were
incubated in a mammalian medium modified with the addition of urea,
trimethylamine N-oxide, NaCl, and bovine serum. Primary monolayers were
passaged with 0.025% trypsin in a modified saline solution. Silky shark
cells grew optimally at 29C. The population doubling time for C.
falciformis cells at passage 29 was 67 hours. For G. cirratum cells at
passage 6 the population doubling was 84 hours. Silky shark cells grew
over a broad range of osmolalities from 315 mOsm to a 1664 mOsm with
optimal growth at 650 mOsm. A medium containing 10% dimethylsulfoxide
allowed for cryopreservation with greater than 65% viability upon recovery.
Current theories of elasmobranch osmoregulation are discussed in light of
experimental data collected from studies conducted on the silky shark cell
line.

The objective of this study was to determine how alterations in the
insulin-receptor trafficking pathway affect ligand-dependent cellular
action in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. Cell lines altered in their
trafficking pathway were selected using a toxic insulin-diphtheria A-chain
molecule (DTaI) which specifically interacts with the insulin receptor.
One cell variant (IV-Al-j) which exhibited decreased insulin binding and
enhanced insulin degradation did not demonstrate insulin or IGF-1
dependent cell proliferation. IV-Al-j cells also failed to produce an
insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (pp175). IGF-1 binding,
insulin-stimulated hexose uptake, epidermal growth factor and thrombin
stimulated cell proliferation were unaltered in IV-Al-j cells. These
results suggest that the insulin and IGF-1 receptor may share a common
pathway post-ligand binding for cell proliferation which does not involve
EGF or thrombin, and that enhanced insulin degradation and loss of pp175
may be responsible for the loss of insulin-stimulated cell proliferation.

With the goal of developing techniques for DNA insertional mutagenesis in
zebrafish, we established procedures for rapidly obtaining and injecting
large numbers of fertilized eggs. Using either of two plasmid constructs,
we injected uncut DNA into fertilized eggs at the one-or two-cell stage.
Injected eggs were raised to sexual maturity and the frequency of
transgenic founder fish determined by pair mating them and testing DNA
extracted from pools of 16-hour embryos using PCR and subsequently
Southern analysis. Eggs injected with one of two different plasmids
yielded no transgenic fish, but 7-25% (19/115 overall) of the eggs
injected with the other transmitted the injected sequences to their
offspring (F1). Of nineteen lines studied further, all were able to pass
the foreign DNA sequences to the next (F2) generation. Inheritance in the
F2 was Mendelian in the seventeen lines tested. PCR and Southern analysis
indicated that the plasmid sequences were amplified. Three founder fish
possessed more than one integration event, and multiple integrations were
found to occur both in the same germline precursor cell, as well as in
different precursors. Although the plasmids injected into the embryos
contained a functional lacZ gene, of twelve lines tested, none of the
transgenic offspring were found to be XGAL-positive. Of thirteen
transgenic lines tested, in only one line was RNA detected in the
offspring. The ability to obtain and inject large numbers of zebrafish
eggs combined with a high frequency of germline integration may be steps
towards the goal of being able to perform insertional mutagenesis with
this organism.

In a screen for mutant phenotypes caused by the insertion of transgenes
into the zebrafish genome, nineteen transgenic lines were bred to
homozygosity. None of the nineteen lines displayed a discernible phenotype
in the homozygous state. Homozygous adult fish were identified in each of
the nineteen transgenic lines, and all were fertile. Seventeen lines were
screened for mutations exhibiting a strict maternal phenotype, and no
mutants were identified. Homozygous lines were generated from each of
twelve transgenic lines, and all were fertile. Cloning the sequences
flanking the insertions of two transgenic lines revealed that these
transgenes had integrated into single-copy sequences of the zebrafish
genome. Analysis of one transgenic line studied further revealed that the
insertion of the transgene had occurred with very little disruption to the
host chromosome: 12 bp had been deleted from the host chromosome, while 23
bp had been deleted from the plasmid.

In an effort to determine whether the insertion of DNA randomly into the
genome of the zebrafish is potentially mutagenic, gene trap constructs
were introduced into cultured zebrafish cells. This cell line, PAC2, is
highly transfectable and demonstrates a high efficiency of cloning. A
second cell line which was also established, HetA, is also transfectable,
but these cells are not clonable. The introduction of lacZ gene trap
constructs into PAC2 cells resulted in a very low frequency of
XGAL-positive colonies. It was found that only by using a very strong
promoter or by concentrating the protein in the nucleus can a level of lacZ
expression be attained for efficient detection by the XGAL test. In
contrast, PAC2 cells are capable of activating a promoterless neomycin
gene at a frequency similar to that observed in cultured mouse cells.
Analysis of the fusion transcript of one of the neomycin resistant PAC2
clones demonstrated that the neomycin resistance gene was activated by
fusion with a gene normally expressed in PAC2 cells. Thus, DNA is capable
of integrating into expressed zebrafish genes, indicating that random DNA
integration is a feasible approach for insertional mutagenesis in the
zebrafish.

Previously in our lab, a mutant Chinese hamster fibroblast line,
designated A1-j, was clonally selected based on its resistance to a toxic
insulin-diphtheria A-chain conjugate (Leckett and Germinario, 1992).
Subsequent examination revealed that while the parental V-79 strain showed
2-fold insulin-stimulated growth (P<0.01), the mutant exhibited no
significant growth above basal levels (P>0.10). Since the mutant's growth
was similarly affected in response to insulin-like growth factor-I, but
not to 5% fetal bovine serum or unrelated growth factors (i.e., alpha-
thrombin or epidermal growth factor), the mitogenic block appears to be
confined to a pathway shared by insulin and IGF-I. Analysis of thymidine
incorporation data, as well as c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression, placed the
causative mutation early in the cell cycle (i.e., the G1->S boundary).
Measurement of [3H]-2DG uptake along with [14C]-glucose incorporation into
glycogen revealed that insulin stimulation of metabolic pathways, namely
glucose transport and glycogen synthesis is intact in the mutant. Although
A1-j cells appear to possess approximately half of the insulin receptor
complement of the parental cell line (800 vs 1500 receptors per cell as
estimated by Scatchard analysis), ligand binding, internalization,
autophosphorylation, and tyrosine kinase activity appear to be unaffected.
Finally, the A1-j cell line appears to mediate insulin proteolysis which
is significantly more resistant to chloroquine inhibition than the wild-
type V-79 strain. 100microM chloroquine was able to rescue 26.4+- 1.4% of
a prebound cohort of insulin from degradation in V-79 cells versus only
18.4 +- 1.5% of prebound insulin being rescued in the A1-j cell line under
identical conditions (P<0.05). These data are consistent with a mutation
in A1-j resulting in an alteration in the normal endosomal routing of
insulin and/or its receptor.

The human mammary gland in vivo is made up of branching epithelial ducts
embedded in a supporting stroma. One of the earliest changes seen in the
development of breast cancers is the disruption of normal tissue
architecture, thereby leading to the loss of the organisation of the
branching ducts. The objective of this study was to set up an in vitro
system whereby the molecules involved in branching morphogenesis of a non
tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line could be analysed. These
molecules would be potential targets for alteration in tumorigenesis, and
also have a potential role in mammary gland development in vivo. This
thesis describes the in vitro system used, analysis of the roles of
fibroblast secreted factors and integrins in the branching morphogenesis
process, and the effect of overexpression of oncogenes on the ability of
cells to form organised morphogenetic structures. The in vitro system
involves culturing a human mammary epithelial cell line (HB2) in 3-
dimensions within a collagen type I (or fibrin) matrix. The cells grow to
form compact, organised, spherical cysts, or can be induced to perform
branching morphogenesis when cultured with conditioned medium from
fibroblasts. We have found that there are at least two distinct soluble
factors that can induce branching morphogenesis; hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), and an unidentified and potentially novel factor secreted by human
foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). Preliminary characterisation of this factor
has shown that it is a heat stable protein with a size of between 35 and
45 kDa. In the analysis of the role of integrins in branching
morphogenesis, we have analysed both the expression of integrins at the
RNA level throughout the morphogenetic time course, and the effect of
specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to integrin subunits. Use of
specific integrin mAbs that inhibit cell-matrix interaction, has shown
that integrin mediated maintenance of cell-matrix interaction is vital
both for the growth of HB2 cells and for maintaining cell-cell
interactions in the branching structures. In both cases the integrins
involved were found to differ depending on the matrix in which the
branching morphogenesis occurred, with the a2?1 important in the collagen
system and the [alpha]v[beta]1 in fibrin. Both HGF and HFF conditioned
medium are shown to stimulate the motility of HB2 cells on collagen, and
it is hypothesised that the stimulation of cell motility is a necessary
event in the branching morphogenesis process, and that the [alpha]2[beta]1
integrin has a specific role in branching morphogenesis by way of
regulating this motility. Evidence for this is provided by showing that
mAbs to the [alpha]2 or [beta]1 integrin subunits that reduce HGF induced
motility also inhibit branching morphogenesis induced by HGF.
Overexpression of the v-Ha-ras oncogene in HB2 cells also led to the
disruption of cell-cell interactions in 3-dimensional morphogenetic
structures. Overexpression of ras induced a reduced level of expression of
the [alpha]2 integrin subunit and a concurrent reduction in adhesion of
the cells to collagen type I. Further evidence that the [alpha]2[beta]1
integrin-collagen interaction is involved in regulating cell-cell
interaction in 3-dimensional structures was provided by showing that the
HB2 ras colony phenotype could be significantly reverted with a mAb to the
[beta]1 integrin subunit which increases the integrin mediated adhesion of
cells to collagen.

Genetic alterations in astrocytic tumors have frequently been examined to
determine areas of possible intervention. Adult and pediatric tumor
samples as well as cell lines established from adult tumors have provided
the substrate for these analyses. Many adult cell lines have been
characterized and used as model systems to study brain tumor progression.
However, limited numbers of pediatric astrocytic cell lines have been
established for these purposes. Three new cell lines have been established
from pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients and two from
pediatric anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) patients. The cell lines were first
characterized for the most common genetic alterations observed in
astrocytic tumors and then were assessed for the potential to
differentiate in response to neurotrophins or retinoids. One cell line
expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein transcript. The transcripts for
EGFR, c-myc, N-myc, and basic fibroblast growth factor were examined for
alterations or overexpression of these genes. All five cell lines
expressed elevated levels of the EGFR transcript when compared to the
normal brain controls. One of the GBM cell lines expressed the c-myc
transcript at high levels as a result of an amplified c-myc gene.
Mutations in the p53 gene were found in all five cell lines. Three of the
cell lines had dominant negative p53 mutations in codons 273 or 248. One
cell line carried a mutation in codon 72 and the other had a loss of
function mutation. The primary tumors from which the cell lines were
derived also contained the same mutations. The expression of genes
required for a potential response to differentiating agents were assessed.
All five cell lines expressed transcripts for trkB and retinoic acid
receptor alpha, beta, and gamma; three expressed retinoic acid X receptor
alpha, and one expressed transcripts for gp75NGFR and trkC. However, none
of the cell lines differentiated after exposure to neurotrophins, retinoic
acids, or retinols. Treatment with retinaldehydes had a cytotoxic effect.
These in vitro findings may help to identify specific genes and compounds
of interest when evaluating new treatment strategies.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY) are potent antisecretory
agonists in the gastrointestinal tract, attenuating electrogenic chloride
and fluid secretion in vitro and in vivo in various species. Human
adenocarcinoma cell lines provide model systems in which to investigate
the mechanisms by which epithelial Y receptors modulate anion transport,
in the absence of other mucosal cell types. Two of these (HT-29 and HCA-7
Colony 1) do not possess PYY receptors and were consequently stably
transfected with the cDNA encoding the Y1 subtype, endogenously expressed
in human colonic mucosa. Both wild type epithelia and the Y1 clones
responded to a similar range of secretory and antisecretory agents when
voltage-clamped in Ussing chambers; in addition, PYY transiently reduced
both basal and cAMP-stimulated short-circuit current in Y1 epithelial
layers. These antisecretory responses were inhibited by the Y1 antagonists
BIBP 3226 and GR231118. Surprisingly, PYY and [Leu31, Pro34] (Pro34) PYY
were 10-20 fold more potent than NPY or Pro34NPY in both HT-29 and Colony
1 clones, despite each agonist displaying equivalent binding affinities.
It is suggested that metabolism by membrane surface peptidases may
underlie this selectivity, and that this may influence responses at native
mucosal Y1 receptors. The Colony 1 Y1 clone was also compared with those
transfected with Y1 receptor cDNAs containing single amino acid mutations.
The Y1(S255E) receptor was apparently down-regulated, with associated
consequences for PYY antisecretory responses; phosphorylation of Ser255 in
the third intracellular loop (imitated by Glu) may therefore be important
in desensitisation. Substitution of Cys337, potentially palmitoylated, did
not alter receptor expression or the functional potency of PYY. However
Y1(C337S) mediated responses remained sustained at high agonist
concentration, indicating that Y1 receptor depalmitoylation may inhibit
its inactivation. Epithelial expression of receptor mutants may therefore
be valuable in assessing their functional properties, particularly
regarding desensitisation.

Embryonic olfactory neuroepithelium provides a useful experimental system
for the study of olfactory neurogenesis. As a substrate for experimental
neural cell biology, olfactory neuroepithelium is of unique interest
since, unlike other neural cells, olfactory neurons are continually
replaced -a feature that is dictated by their direct exposure to the
damaging external environment. Basal cells in the olfactory placode are
the source of this replacement. Each olfactory neuron expresses only one
or a few of the many olfactory receptors that are encoded by the large
array of olfactory genes. Despite this limited cellular display of
receptors, vertebrates are able to distinguish many thousands of different
odorants, implying a complicated need for perceptive neurological
processing of signals coming from individual olfactory neurons. To study
the events that take place during the differentiation of neuronal
precursors - a process that sustains a diverse receptor repertoire - I felt
that lines of conditionally immortalised cells that could be induced to
differentiate would provide useful reagents. In this thesis I describe my
successful attempts to immortalise olfactory cell lines from the
neuroepithelium of E 10.5 mouse embryos. I used a conditionally
immortalising retrovirus that included the coding sequence for the
temperature-sensitive SY 40 large T antigen. Integration of this
retrovirus into the genome of cells allowed continuous proliferation at
the permissive temperature of 33 Celsius. A shift to the nonpermissive
temperature of 39 Celsius inactivated the SV40 large T antigen, the cells ceased
proliferation and differentiation commenced. Sixty cell lines were derived
of which four were chosen for further characterisation. These four cell
lines (OP6, OP27, OP47 and OP55) were clonally derived and were
immortalised rather than transformed. They continued to express the SV40
large T antigen at 33 Celsius but lost expression at 39 Celsius concomitant with
cessation of proliferation. When the OP cells were shifted to 39 Celsius in the
absence or presence of the morphogen, retinoic acid, morphological changes
ensued that were consistent with the development of neuronal
characteristics. The OP6, OP27 and the OP47 cells became phase-bright with
neuritic extensions. The OP55 cells were the exception in that they did
not develop extensions but instead differentiated to form compact
epithelial islands when grown in DM-10 medium but not in RA medium.
Differentiation of the OP cells at 39 Celsius was further documented by the
induced expression of a number of markers demonstrated by RT-PCR and/or
immunocytochemistry. The OP cells differentiated at 39 Celsius in DM-10 and
in retinoic acid-containing medium to express olfactory receptor transcripts.
Cloning and sequencing showed that each cell line expressed a single
receptor type but that different receptors were expressed by different
cell lines. Sequencing revealed that the receptors cloned from the OP27
cells were 98% homologous to the mouse-M65 olfactory receptor whereas OP55
had greatest homology to rat-Olf3 olfactory receptor. The transcripts
induced in OP6 and the OP47 cells showed greatest homology with Gus58 -a
taste receptor homologous to olfactory receptors. Sequences obtained from
OP6, OP47 and OP55 cells were not 100% identical to published receptors
and could thus represent members of different subfamilies. Interestingly,
induced OP55 cells also expressed mRNA for clusterin - a molecule that has
no homology with olfactory receptor transcripts but is involved in
differentiation during embryogenesis.

Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is an important intracellular
antioxidant enzyme, which has been suggested to play a role in tumour
biology. In the present study, the expression and possible role of MnSOD
in malignant pleural mesothelioma was investigated.

Mesothelial cells in healthy visceral pleural tissue showed no MnSOD
immunoreactivity in five out of six cases, whereas moderate or high
immunoreactivity for MnSOD was detected in 30 out of 42 (71%) cases of
mesothelioma. Only two of the 21 cases with metastatic adenocarcinoma of
the pleura showed moderate MnSOD immunoreactivity, the remaining 19 (90.5%)
showing negative or weak reactivity (p<0.001, by Fisher's exact test
compared to mesothelioma). The immunostaining of catalase, a hydrogen
peroxide scavenging antioxidant enzyme, was detectable in 27 of the 35
(77%) mesothelioma cases studied, whereas all the five samples of healthy
pleural mesothelium were negative. Reactive mesothelium showed positive
immunoreactivity for MnSOD and catalase, suggesting that induction of
these enzymes is not specific for mesothelioma.

Two continuous human mesothelioma cell lines showed higher MnSOD activity,
immunoreactive protein and mRNA levels than non-malignant mesothelial
cells. In addition, mesothelioma cells expressing the highest MnSOD levels
had the highest levels of catalase and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase.
The mitochondria of these cells expressed higher MnSOD and lower
superoxide levels than non-malignant mesothelial cells. The mesothelioma
cells with the highest antioxidant enzyme levels were most resistant to
oxidant-and drug-induced injury and to drug-induced apoptosis compared to
non-malignant mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cells with lower MnSOD
and catalase levels.

The extent of cell proliferation and apoptosis of mesothelioma tissue were
14.1 +- 13.2% and 1.1 +- 1.2%, respectively. MnSOD expression was inversely
associated with cell proliferation (p=0.02 by t-test), and a tendency
for a better prognosis among patients with moderate or strong MnSOD
expression was demonstrated. Patients displaying a tumour with enhanced
proliferation or apoptosis had a poorer prognosis (p<0.001 by Log Rank
test).

In conclusion, the MnSOD level is usually high in pleural mesothelioma,
which may affect the proliferation and drug-resistance of mesothelioma
cells. MnSOD immunostaining can thus possibly be used to distinguish
mesothelioma from metastatic adenocarcinoma but not from reactive
mesothelium.

only a few are immortalized or neoplaslically transformed in vitro. The
tumor promoter phenobarbital has an inhibiting effect on diethyl
nitrosamine-induced, established liver cell lines. Epidermal growth
factors such as hepatocyte-stimulating substances can promote DNA
synthesis or migration when the receptors are expressed. Depending on the
liver cell type and degree of differentiation, growth factors act
differently and synergistically with a large number of other components.
They are only partially cell-specific and often have a paracrine effect,
which results in different effects in primary, mixed-cell cultures than in
pure hepatocyte cultures.

The ten examined liver cell lines showed partly good differentiation and
stable morphology (CL 38). In lines that were difficult to establish (CL
52), the in vitro progression correlated with the occurrence of genetic
instability. The chromosome analyzes did not reveal any aberrations
specifically attributable to immortalization or neoplastic transformation.
A 3p or 11p deletion was often found, but with the progression and
occurrence of a mitotic rate sufficient for karyotyping, several
structural aberrations, karyotype heterogeneity and, not only after in
vivo transplantation, variability were detectable. Regardless of the
degree of differentiation or a morphology that remained stable for years,
all cell lines showed constant and increasing karyotype alterations. Thus,
newly occurring chromosome aberrations were only associated with changes
in growth or morphology in exceptional cases. A comparison with liver cell
lines from the literature and two spontaneous tumors, however, showed that
some regions of the RNO # 1, 3, 10 and # 11, 4, 6 and 7 not only in liver
cells, but generally in carcinomas of the rat are involved. The CL and FL
induced in vivo by continuous diethyl nitrosamine administration did not
show any carcinogen-specific chromosome alteration. In contrast, a single
dose of methylnitrosourea in vivo resulted in # 4 aberrations in all three
examined NT cell lines, as were also described for ethylnitrosourea-
induced neurogenic tumors.

Numerical chromosome losses associated with the progression were only
partially due to translocations, preferably to centromeres and dead cells.
When hypodiploidy was reached, the cell lines only remained if they were
able to (hypo) tetraploidize. Endoreduplication of individual chromosomes
or non-disjunction preserved For the limited survival time of already
propagated subcultures, as well as the lines CL 44 and CL 49-VII, a
telomere loss or a lack of telomerase is possible. The cell line CL 50
shows considerable cell division disorders with its mononuclear cells,
multipolar mitoses, micronuclei and PCCs. In relation to the latency
period until tumor formation, the degree of malignancy of the lines
correlates neither with the heterogeneity of the cell population, nor does
the aneuploidy correlate with the number of cylogenetically recognizable
aberrations. The essentially adherent line CL 49-VIII shows high cell
death in mitosis in the event of hyperconfluence. Nevertheless, it shows
short latency times and high metastasis in vivo. Oligonucleosomes typical
of apoptosis could be determined for cell loss, which is dependent on cell
density. The established lines CL 50 and CL 49 are a suitable in vitro
system for investigating the complex mechanisms of karyo-and cytokinesis,
or factors that lead to cell death through apoptosis.

As a sensitive in vitro system, the establishment of the liver cell lines
can provide generally valid information for primary epilhelic cell
cultures from parenchymal tissues. The classic karyotype analysis is not
very suitable for the detection of genetic aberrations in the case of
insufficient proliferation and lack of mitoses in initiated or
preneoplastic cells. For the cell type-specific investigation of early
stages of the cancerogenesis process, in situ hybridization on interphase
nuclei is the current method of choice. However, chromosome and gene
specific probes are not commercially available for Rattus norvegicus.

Immunological mechanisms, ie the body's own defense systems, are central
to the defense against malignant cells as well. Cytokines are molecules
produced by the immune system that have been shown in the literature to
have an anti-proliferative effect on both normal cells and cancer cells.
Several clinical and experimental findings suggest that this is also the
case for gynecological cancer. Quite encouraging are the findings that in
certain patient cases, cancer can even be treated with molecules produced
by the immune system: cytokines.

In this thesis, which consists of five parts, I have studied a number of
commercial cytokines in human impact of gynecological cancer cell growth.
The subject of the study is ovarian, uterine trunk and ectopic cancer
cells.

As the cell prepares to divide, it begins to synthesize a new genetic
material, DNA. This dissertation research focuses on the inhibition of
cytokine-induced DNA synthesis in cancer cells, and in particular the
mechanisms by which cytokines inhibit cell proliferation. Cytokines
possible mechanisms of cell growth inhibitory concentration,
intracellularly in programmed cell death (apoptosis), and transcription
factors AP-1 (activating protein 1) and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappaB)
activation. AP-1 and NF-kappaB are proteins that, when bound to DNA,
regulate the function of genes involved in growth and development in many
cells.

The effect of cytokines on the proliferation of cancer cells was studied
with radiolabeled uridine, which, as a "building block" of DNA, applied to
the nuclei of cells the more new DNA was produced in the cell. The effect
of cell growth inhibitory cytokines on the activity of transcription
factors was investigated by so-called EMSA tests (electrophoretic mobility
shift assay). AP-1 was found to be activated in the nucleus under stem
cell culture conditions without cytokine activity in all cell lines. Its
activity was increased by some cell growth inhibitory cytokines in uterine
and ovarian cancer cells. Although a direct relationship between AP-1
activation and growth inhibitory activity cannot be demonstrated in these
tests, it is possible that AP-1 plays an important role in the regulation
of cytokine-induced growth inhibition. This interpretation is supported by
the findings in the literature on the role of AP-1 as a regulator of cell
growth.

The transcription factor NF-kappaB was also found to be continuously
activated in the nucleus in all cell lines. Binding of DNA was increased
by a cell growth inhibitory cytokine, the so-called The effect of TNF-
alpha in ovarian and vulvar cancer cells. Based on the literature,
NF-kappaB is also an important regulator of cell growth, and it is possible
that NF-kappaB is involved in the regulation of TNF-alpha-mediated
inhibition of cell division in cancer cells studied.

According to the literature, several cytokines also cause apoptosis in
malignant cells. It is typical of so-called programmed cell death that in
a dying cell, the DNA is cleaved into short fragments, which can be
detected when colored DNA fragments of different weights travel through
the gel in an electric field. In that study, spontaneous apoptosis was
observed in only one ovarian cancer cell line, which interferon gamma was
able to reduce. According to the literature, NF-kappaB is capable of
inhibiting apoptosis. This phenomenon may well explain the inability of
cell growth inhibitory cytokines to induce apoptosis in the cancer cells
studied.

Very little is known about the growth-regulating effect of cytokines,
especially in ectopic cancer. The function of transcription factors that
regulate cell growth in gynecological cancer cells has also been studied a
little in the past, and therefore this dissertation provides new
information about the biology of these cancers. The project may have
concrete clinical applications in terms of the biology of malignant cell
changes and the treatment of cancer. The role of immunological regulatory
molecules (cytokines) in support of traditional cancer therapies in
gynecological cancer, for example, may be significant in the near future.

Homeobox transcription factors play critical roles in the genetic cascade
of development. Critical to understanding their function is describing the
expression and identifying the downstream targets of homeobox genes. The
initial characterization of the dispersed homeobox gene Gsh-1 is reported
in chapter 2. In situ hybridization showed developmental expression was
limited to the CNS. In the hindbrain and neural tube stripes of Gsh-1 were
seen in neuroepithelial tissue. The diencephalon and mesencephalon also
showed Gsh-1 expression including the future thalamus and hypothalamus.
Using a fusion protein approach, the in vitro consensus DNA binding site
of Gsh-1 was determined. Chapter 3 reports the characterization of kidney
cell lines derived from Hoxa 11-SV40 T antigen transgenic mice. Molecular
marker analysis determined the mK3 and mK4 cell lines represent early
metanephric mesenchyme and differentiated epithelial-like cells
respectively. Co-culture experiments with isolated ureteric bud
demonstrated mK3 cells retained early metanephric mesenchyme function by
supporting ureteric bud growth. Expression profile comparisons of the mK3
and mK4 cell lines identified 121 differentially expressed genes. Several
of these were previously described in the differentiation of metanephric
mesenchyme, validating the approach. The remaining genes, consisting of
both known and unknown, are now implicated in this process. Chapter 4
describes the identification of candidate downstream targets of Hoxa 11.
The Hoxa 11-SV40 T antigen transgene described in chapter 3 was bred into
the Hoxa 11/Hoxd 11 double mutant mouse line. A kidney cell line, mK10,
was isolated from mutant transgenic E18.5 embryos (Hoxa 11-/-Hoxd 11 -/-
Hoxa 11/SV40 Tag +). The mK10 cells, as well as HEK293 cells, were
transfected with expression constructs containing the Hoxa 11 cDNA to
create cell populations with and without Hoxa 11 for each. Differential
Display, GDA arrays, and GeneChip microarrays were used for expression
profile comparisons. These screens identified nine genes that were
reproducibly altered in expression with the addition of Hoxa 11 expression.
Integrin alpha 8 (ItgA8) was altered in both cell lines. In situ
hybridization of E13.5 Hoxa 11/Hoxd 11 mutant kidneys showed ItgA8
expression was altered, consistent with ItgA8 being a downstream target of
Hoxa 11.

The crucial characteristic of malignant tumors is their ability to
metastasize. At the molecular level, many different genes and gene
products are involved in the regulation of metastasis. One of these genes
is nm23, originally described in malignant melanoma cells as a metastasis
inhibitor and different isoforms exist. It was shown that both for nm23-H1
and nm23-H2 mutations in human tumors can occur. So far very little was
known about the function of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 in human renal cell
carcinoma and human epithelioid sarcoma and mutational analyzes of both
genes in these tumors had not been carried out. The aim of the present
work was to investigate human renal cell carcinoma and epithelioid
sarcomas on expression and the existence of mutations of genes nm23-H1 and
nm23-H2. For this purpose, 26 human renal carcinoma cell lines and 3
clonal cells subpopulations of the human epitheloid sarcoma cell line GRU-1
were analyzed by means of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2-specific RT-PCR and
followed by the sequencing of the complete open reading frames of nm23-H1
and nm23-H2. In all 26 renal carcinoma cell lines nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 were
detectable at RNA level. In the sequencing of both genes a point mutation
of nm23-H1 was detected in one of the renal carcinoma cell line. However,
by analyzing different passage numbers of this cell line and the primary
tumor, it could be shown that the observed nm23-H1 mutation corresponded
to a cell culture artifact. For nm23-H2, 2 different point mutations could
be detected in a renal carcinoma cell line. However, since these were not
associated with an amino acid exchange, a functional relevance for these
mutations can be excluded. Thus, mutations of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 in human
renal cell carcinoma appear to be a very rare event unlikely to affect the
genesis and progression of these tumors. In addition, it was demonstrated
for the first time in this work that epitheloid sarcomas also express
nm23-H1 and nm23-H2. However, mutations of both genes could not be detected
in the investigated cell lines, so that the known differences of these cell
lines in biological behavior can not be explained by mutations of nm23-H1
and nm23-H2.

The establishment of fish cell lines plays an important role in aquatic
animal virology, environmental toxicology, fish resource protection and
genetic breeding, and fish endocrinology. Since the establishment of the
world's first fish cell line, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
gonadal cell line RTG-2, more than 280 cell lines of different tissue
origin including freshwater fish and marine fish have been established so
far, but the gonad origin somatic cell lines are relatively rare. Fish
gonadal cells include granulosa cells, sheath cells, interstitial cells of
the ovary, and Sertoli cells and Leydig cells of the testis. They play a
decisive role in the proliferation, differentiation and development of
germ cells, especially in recent years The focus of stem cell research
makes the cultivation of gonadal cells and the establishment of cell lines
particularly necessary. Studies have shown that using zebrafish (Danio
rerio) gonadal cells as a feeder layer, their reproductive stem cells can
be cultured in vitro for months. The southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis
Chen) belongs to the genus Polygonaceae and is a valuable economic fish
mainly distributed in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River in
China. It has fast growth speed, tender meat, wide temperature range, and
strong disease resistance. It has become one of the important farmed fish
in China. Under natural conditions, the sex ratio of southern catfish
is about 1:1. Interestingly, the offspring of southern catfish are
almost all females under artificial breeding conditions. Although this has
been explored for many years now, its specific mechanism remains to be
further studied. The establishment of the southern catfish gonadal cell
line is expected to provide a powerful tool for the study of the culture,
proliferation and differentiation of germ cells, especially germ stem
cells, the effects of functional genes and environmental endocrine
disruptors.

On the other hand, in recent years, more and more reports show that
environmental estrogen pollution in waters around the world is increasing,
which has significant effects on human and animal reproductive
developmental abnormalities, malignant tumors, and metabolic disorders.
Real-time and efficient monitoring is a prerequisite for preventing and
controlling its pollution. There are many types of environmental estrogen
substances, large quantities and small amounts, and their biological
detection has an irreplaceable status and role. It has been reported that
the pEGFP-ERa, a eukaryotic expression vector capable of stably expressing
mammalian estrogen receptor (Estrogen Receptora, ERa) and the true
expression vector containing four tandem estrogen receptor response
elements (ERE) The nuclear expression plasmid pGL3-ERE4-luc was co-
transfected into mammalian cells to monitor the estrogen activity of
environmental estrogens. This method has the advantages of high
efficiency, speed, and high sensitivity. However, the expression of the
environment and related molecules in fish cells is significantly different
from that of mammalian cells, and the sensitivity to environmental
estrogen is also significantly different. Therefore, can the above-
mentioned detection system of mammalian cells reflect the effects of
environmental estrogen on fish, For further study. In view of this, this
study mainly carried out two aspects of work. On the one hand, the
southern catfish ovary and testis somatic cell lines were established and
their biological characteristics were identified; on the other hand, the
channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) ERa was established. The eukaryotic
expression vectors pEGFP-ccERa and pGL3-ERE4-luc were co-transformed into
mammalian cells and fish gonadal cell lines, respectively, and compared
and analyzed in order to establish a highly sensitive detection system for
the effects of environmental estrogens on fish. details as follows:

(I) Establishment and biological characteristics of the southern catfish
ovary and testis somatic cell line

(1) Southern catfish ovary somatic cell line About 3 months old Southern
catfish ovary tissue was digested with collagenase IV and trypsin-EDTA,
and contained 15% fetal bovine Serum (FBS), 25 mM Hepes, 1% non-essential
amino acids, 0.5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF), 1 ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 500 U/mL L-15
medium of penicillin, streptomycin, and 5% southern catfish serum was
cultured at 28 Celsius. The chromosome karyotype analysis, RT-PCR, gene
transfection and other methods were used to identify its biological
characteristics. The results showed that: after 2-3 days of isolation and
culture, fibroblast-like growth began. After about 15 days, a monolayer
was grown, digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and subcultured at 1:2. The
initial cell growth was slower after passage, with an average of 7-passage
on 10 days, after the passage to the 9th passage, the cell growth is
accelerated, and the passage is performed on average 3-6 days; the current
cells have been stably passaged to the 90th passage after 18 months of
subculture, and named SCO1. SCO1 in different media: (DMEM, L-15,
DMEM/F12), different blood concentration (5%, 15%, 25%) and culture at
different temperature conditions (18, 28, 37 Celsius). The results showed
that the culture was performed at 28 Celsius in L-15 medium of 15% fetal
bovine serum. SCO1 optimal growth: RT-test results showed the PCR, the
expression SCO1 Foxl2, Sf1 and Wt1b, do not express Vasa, Wt1a, Cyp19a and
Dmrt1 (d) The 70th generation SCO1 karyotype analysis results show that
the chromosome number of more than 80% of the cells is 50-65, of which the
division phase of 2n=58 accounts for 62%, and shows a normal diploid
karyotype. The hrGFP-1a plasmid was transfected with SCO1 with TransIT(@)-
2020. The expression of green fluorescent protein was observed 24 hours
later. By 48 hours, the expression of the target protein was visible in
about 30% of the cells.

(2) Southern catfish testis cell line The same method as above was used to
establish the southern catfish testis cell line. The cell morphology is
fibroblast-like. It has been cultured for 15 months and has been stably
passed to the 56th generation. It is named SCT1. Analysis of the
chromosome number and karyotype of SCT1 at the 19th and 43th generation
showed that the chromosome number of more than 70% of the cells was 50-65,
and the division phase of 2n=58 accounted for 52%, showing a normal
diploid karyotype; RT-PCR The analysis showed that SCT1 expressed Sf1 and
Foxl2, but not Vasa, Wt1a, Wt1b, Cyp19a, and Dmrt1; pIRES-hrGFP-1a plasmid
was transfected with SCT1, and about 25% of cells expressed green
fluorescent protein 48 hours later.

(II) Establishment of environmental estrogen detection system (a) RT-PCR
cloning and obtaining the full-length cDNA sequence of the estrogen a
receptor of Ictalurus punctatus, and the eukaryotic expression vector
pEGFP-ccERa was successfully constructed. (b) pEGFP-ccERa and pGL3-ERE4-
luc were co-transformed into HEK293 and SCO1, and compared with the human
estrogen receptor expression vector pEGFP-hERa. The results show that the
detection limit of E2 in HEK293 cells for pEGFP-hERa is 10-10 mmol/L, 10-9
mmol/L in SCO1, and pEGFP-ccERa is just the opposite, that is, the
detection limit of E2 in HEK293 is 10-9 mmol/L, and 10-10 mmol/L in SCO1.
Therefore, it was shown that pEGFP-ccERa has higher sensitivity to detect
estrogen luciferase activity in fish cells SCO1 than pEGFP-hERa. (c) 17a-
methyltestosterone (MT), 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2), estradiol (E2),
bisphenol propane with different estrogen-like activity levels at the same
concentration (10-5 mmol/L) (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), ethylestradiol (DES)
and octylphenol (OP) treated cells. After 48 h, the relative activity of
luciferase was measured. The results showed that the relative activity of
environmental estrogen luciferase The size is consistent with its
corresponding estrogen activity (ie EE2> E2> DES> BPA> OP> NP> MT), which
indicates that pEGFP-ccERa can accurately detect the estrogen activity of
environmental estrogens.

To sum up, this study successfully established the southern catfish ovary
and testis somatic cell lines, namely SCO1 and SCT1, and successfully
constructed the P. punctatus estrogen a receptor expression vector pEGFP-
ccERa, which was co-transformed with pGL3-ERE4-luc into SCO1, thus
establishing an environmental estrogen detection system. The research not
only provided the necessary platform and tools for the culture of germ
cells, especially germline stem cells, and functional genes, etc., but
also laid an important foundation for the detection of environmental
estrogens.

Germ cells are specialized cells that give rise to all other cell types
resulting in the development of a new individual. Improper germ cell
maturation can lead to sterility or the development of a germ cell tumor
(GCT). GCTs constitute approximately 90% of all testicular neoplasms,
making them essential in the study of testicular tumor pathology. Most
GCTs arise from the gonads, however the origin of extragonadal GCTs is yet
to be conclusively determined. Theoretical explanations as to the
derivation of extragonadal tumors include secondary metastasis, abnormal
migration of primodial germ cells, or undifferentiated pluripotent cells.
The SEM-1 cell line was developed from a patient with mediastinal germ
cell tumor. The focus of this thesis is to determine if the SEM-1 cell
line is a seminoma by characterization studies such as gross,
histological, immunochemical, and cytogenetic analyses.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines were established to generate
autologous T-cell lines. With the RCC cell line MZ1257RC modified to
express the costimulatory molecule B7-1 at the cell surface, different
autologous T-cell lines were raised and characterized. The identification
of a tumor associated antigen was started using an autologous, HLA-A2
restricted T-cell clone in cDNA expression cloning. After in vitro-
sensitization of peripheral blood monocytes with the autologous RCC cell
line MZ2733RC, a HLA class I restricted T-cell line XIE6 was raised, which
lyses the autologous and various allogeneic RCC cell lines, but not the
autologous kidney cells. The T-cells express TZR-Vbeta13.6-chains and release
GM-CSF and IL-10 after antigen stimulation. Although this RCC cell line is
less sensitive towards autologous and allogeneic effector cells. Finally,
blocking of its HLA class I molecules on the cell surface enhances its
sensitivity to lymphokine activated killer cells. A reason for this may be
the expression of non-classical HLA class Ib molecules, especially HLA-G.
Seven different HLA-G transcripts were detected in RNA from carcinoma cell
lines, but not from kidney cells. In a detailed analysis, HLA-G
transcripts were found in RCC cell lines (58%), in RCC biopsies (80%) and
only in 10% of kidney epithelium biopsies. In the RCC cell line MZ2733RC a
constitutive HLA-G1 protein expression was observed, which is inducible by
IFN-gamma-treatment.

cell lines with an impaired E-cadherin adhesion. Possible implications of
epithelial/mesenchymal transition for prostate carcinogenesis are
discussed.

Chapter III. The genetic background of 14 widely used prostate carcinoma
cell lines is analyzed by cytogenetics, DNA profiling and mutation
analysis. Several supposedly unique cell lines appear to have a common
origin. Guidelines for cell line use are discussed.

Chapter IV. Two cell lines previously believed to be of prostatic origin

In the present work the expression of the TRAIL system in human renal
carcinoma cell lines was investigated. For the first time two previously
unknown alternative TRAIL splice variants could be identified and
characterized. In the TRAIL beta isoform, the processing of the exon 3
leads to the translation of a truncated 98 amino acid protein with loss of
the extracellular domain. The additional processing of exon 2 leads to the
generation of the TRAIL-gamma variant with 52 amino acids and almost
complete truncation of the extracellular binding domains. Due to the loss
of the extracellular domain of these TRAIL variants, which appears
essential for signal induction by receptor binding, an apoptotic effect is
very questionable. While TRAIL alpha and beta have a cytoplasmic
localization. In addition, a previously unidentified splice variant of the
type 4 TRAIL receptor was discovered. This form has truncation of the
cysteine-rich domain 1, which is important for the ligand-receptor
interaction. This may lead to a changed affinity of the ligand-receptor
complex. As has already been shown, rhTRAIL induces apoptotic cell death
in human renal carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, a primary TRAIL
sensitivity could be enhanced by co-administration of the topoisomerase
inhibitor topotecan (hycamtin). The mechanisms responsible for this were
not yet known. For this reason, the role of the IAP family was
specifically examined in this context. A significant decrease in the
expression of IAP-2 after topotecan administration was observed. Survivin,
another member of the IAP family, has recently gained particular attention
through its selective re-expression in malignant transformed tissue. A
significant correlation was found between poor prognosis of different
types of malignant tumors and increased survivin expression. After
identification of the splice variants survivin-deltaEx3 and -2B with
different anti-apoptotic potential, the in vivo expression of survivin
variants in the gastric and renal cell carcinomas was investigated. In the
gastric and renal cell carcinomas, a significant decrease in the
expression of proapototic survivin-2B was observed in advanced tumor
stages. The more aggressive clear cell renal cell carcinomas showed a
significantly higher expression of survivin variants than
chromophilic/papillary differentiated renal cell carcinomas. The decrease
of proapototic survivin-2B could reduce the willingness to apoptotic cell
death during tumor progression.

The transplantable tumor animal model may objectively simulate the process
of growTH in human tumor. Accordingly, it was generally applied to the
research of the tumorigenic mechanism and the screening of the anti-tumor
drugs. In the long process of passage, tumor cell strains are exposed to
variety of unstable factors, such as genetic pollution and genovariation.
Therefore, through a long time it is possible that variation of genetic
mass and the following changes in biological characteristics may decrease
the homogenicity and comparison of tumor animal models. If wanting to keep
the stability of the animal models of transplanted tumors, we have to give
quality control on the tumor cell strains. Hepatoma 22 (H22) is one of the
most usually used mice transplanted tumor cell lines and widely applied to
make the mouse tumor models. This cell line has been set up for nearly 50
years. Many scholars reported that it had already undergone biggish
genetic variance and the cell strains conserved in different institutes
had been found large difference. Liu junxu etc have made H22 cloning and
got 4 clone strains, including H22-H8D8, H22-H2C4, H22-H2G4 and H22-H2E10.

Insect cell lines are very valuable tools for biological research. This
study was focused on how to establish cell lines of insect fat bodies
through primary culture and to explore the mechanism of proliferation of
insect fat body cells in vitro, in order to provide reliable methods to
establish more insect cell lines, in which the methods of explanted
culture of animal tissues was referred. The cells of primary culture were
obtained successfully from larval fat bodies of healthy Anoplophora
glabripennis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We tried to find a method to
establish new cell lines that adapted to our lab through comparing the age
of the larvae, the size and integrality of the fat body tissue, the
surface of the tissue culture, the medium and its pH, the scale of the
accretion (phenylthiourea, PTU) and the adherence of primary culture
tissues to culture surface. We also researched the methods, culture
conditions and occasions of subculture. As a result, the integrated fat
body tissues of the pre-pupae larvae were used as the best material in
establishing insect cell lines. The new plastic culture flask is the best
choice. The optimum medium that was used as the primary medium was TNM-FH
(80%) supplemented with FBS(10%) and PTU(10%). Its pH ranged from 6.2 to 6.8.
The two key steps from primary culture to first subculture included
making the primary culture tissue attach to the surface of the culture
flask tightly and transferring the culture to a new flask carefully
without disturbing the primary culture tissues when proliferating cells
full of the bottom of the flask. Six new cell lines were initiated from the
larval fat bodies of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which
were designated as IOZCAS-Spex-II, IOZCAS-Spex-III, IOZCAS-Spex-IV,
IOZCAS-Spex-V, IOZCAS-Spex-VI, IOZCAS-Spex-VII, respectively. One new cell
line (IOZCAS-Ha-I) was established from the larval fat bodies of Helicoverpa
armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The spherical cells were predominant
among the various cell types. The population doubling times for
IOZCAS-Spex-II and IOZCAS-Ha-I were 108.8h and 65h, respectively.

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on the short arm of chromosome 6
includes the classical HLA genes and in addition HLA-related and non-HLA
related genes. The majority of the genes located in this region are
directly or indirectly involved in the immune response. The polymorphic
HLA molecules, encoded by the HLA genes, bind endogenous and exogenous
peptides. Stable bound peptides are recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells,
which elicit a humoral or cytotoxic immune response to pathogens. The
immunological function of HLA molecules in transplantation has been widely
studied. The role of HLA in autoimmune disease and cancer however is less
obvious. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) aberrant HLA
expression patterns have been observed on primary tumour cells and lymph
node metastases, suggesting an aberrant immune response. Whether the
aberrant expression resides in the HLA genes themselves or is as a result
of other genes within the HLA region is poorly understood. This thesis
describes how the HLA region on the short arm of chromosome 6 is
associated with the pathogenesis of HNSCC. Associations with particular
HLA-B alleles and HLA-B-DRB1 haplotypes were identified. However, since
few patients carried these alleles and haplotype, this could not be the
primary risk factor for the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The MICA gene is in
linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B and involved in the innate and adaptive
immune system. Allelic polymorphism for the MICA gene was evaluated with a
refined method for determination of MICA allele polymorphism based upon
the combination of nucleotide polymorphisms in exons 2, 3 and 4 and repeat
polymorphism in exon 5. No differences in MICA allelic polymorphism were
identified between patients and controls. Repeat length polymorphism,
present in the MICA transmembrane region and encoded by exon 5, revealed a
significant decrease in the frequency for the MICA-A9 repeat in the
patients. Analysis of MICA protein expression indicated that the majority
of tumours expressed MICA. The expression of MICA was not correlated with
the length of the repeat present in the transmembrane region. To evaluate
the role of non-HLA related genes, located within the HLA region and which
confer susceptibility to HNSCC, disease-associated regions were defined
using microsatellite analysis in pooled DNA analysis. Microsatellite
analysis revealed three associated regions, one in the class I region and
two in the class II region. From the associated regions 18 genes were
selected and evaluated for their RNA expression in tumour tissue compared
to surrounding healthy tissue. MICA RNA expression was significantly
increased in tumour tissue while a significant decrease in RNA expression
was observed for hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 8 (HSD17B8) in
tumour tissue. For retinoid X receptor beta (RXRbeta) and NOTCH4 a
decreased, but non-significant, RNA expression in tumour tissue was
observed. These results show that apart from HLA genes also other genes in
the HLA region are associated with the pathogenesis of HNSCC.

Activation of a telomere maintenance mechanism is a vital step in the
development of most cancers and provides a target for the selective
killing of cancer cells. Cancers can use either telomerase or Alternative
Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) to maintain their telomeres and inhibition
of either telomere maintenance mechanism can cause cancer cells to undergo
senescence or apoptosis. Although telomerase inhibitors are undergoing
clinical trials, on commencing this study very little was known about the
role of ALT in cancer, what proteins were involved in its mechanism and
regulation and how it could be targeted clinically. The primary aim of
this thesis was to develop an assay for ALT suitable for examining
archived tumour specimens and to begin using it to examine the prevalence
and clinical significance of ALT in cancer. This assay and gene expression
analysis was also used to identify genes that are involved in or
associated with the activation of the ALT mechanism, to contribute towards
the overall goal of an ALT cancer therapy. The ALT mechanism involves
recombination mediated replication and ALT cells have a marked increase in
a range of recombinational events specifically at their telomeres.
Presumably, as a consequence of this the telomere lengths of ALT cells are
very heterogeneous and on average long. This can be detected by terminal
restriction fragment (TRF) Southern analysis, which has been used
previously as the definitive test for ALT activity. However, TRF analysis
requires intact genomic DNA and is unsuitable for tumour specimens which
are commonly archived by paraffin embedding. Another hallmark of ALT is
ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) which are the subset of PML bodies that
contain telomeric DNA. Work done in this study to consolidate APBs as a
hallmark of ALT, combined with published data, showed 29/31 ALT[+], 3/31
telomerase[+] and 0/10 mortal cell lines/strains are APB[+]. The three
APB[+]/telomerase[+] cell lines identified here had an order of magnitude
lower frequency of APB[+] nuclei than the ALT[+] cell lines. APBs may be
functionally linked to the ALT mechanism and contain the recombination
proteins that are thought to be involved in the ALT mechanism. This study,
in collaboration with Dr W-Q Jiang, strengthened this functional link by
demonstrating that loss of ALT activity (as determined by TRF analysis)
coincided with the disruption of APBs. The detection of APBs was developed
into a robust assay for ALT in archived tumour specimens using a technique
of combined immunofluorescence and telomere fluorescence in situ
hybridisation. It was demonstrated that the APB assay concurred exactly
with the standard assay for ALT (TRF analysis) in 60 tumours for which TRF
analysis gave unequivocal results. The APB assay may be a more appropriate
technique in the case of tumour specimen heterogeneity, which may explain
why the APB assay was able to give definitive results when TRF analysis
was equivocal. We demonstrated that intratumoral heterogeneity for ALT
does exist and this could explain why about 3% of tumours in this study
were APB[+] but with more than a ten-fold reduction in the frequency of
APB[+] nuclei. This study also made the novel discovery of single stranded
C-rich telomeric DNA inside APBs which potentially could be used to make
the APB assay more suitable for routine pathology laboratory use. The APB
assay was used to show that ALT is a significant concern for oncology. ALT
was utilised in approximately one quarter of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM), one third of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) including three quarters of
malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH), half of osteosarcomas and one tenth
of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Furthermore, the patients with
these ALT[+] tumours had poor survival; median survivals were 2 years for
ALT[+] GBM, 4 years for ALT[+] STS including 3.5 years for ALT[+] MFH and
5 years for ALT[+] osteosarcoma. ALT[+] STS and osteosarcomas were also
just as aggressive as their ALT[-] counterparts in terms of grade and
patient outcome. ALT status was not found to be associated with response
to chemotherapy in osteosarcomas or survival in STS. ALT was however, less
prevalent in metastatic STS. The APB assay was a prognostic indicator for
GBM and was correlated with three fold increased median survival in GBM
(although this survival was still poor). ALT was more common in lower
grade astrocytomas (88% ALT[+]) than GBM (24% ALT[+]) and ALT[+] GBM had
an identical median age at diagnosis to that reported for secondary GBM.
It is discussed that these data indicate that ALT was indirectly
associated with secondary GBM and is possibly an early event in its
progression from lower grade astrocytoma. This is relevant because
secondary GBM have distinct genetic alterations that may facilitate
activation of the ALT mechanism. Putative repressors of ALT could explain
why this study found that ALT varied among the different STS subtypes. ALT
was common in MFH (77%), leiomyosarcoma (62%) and liposarcoma (33%) but
rare in rhabdomyosarcoma (6%) and synovial sarcoma (9%). ALT was not found
in colorectal carcinoma (0/31) or thyroid papillary carcinoma (0/17) which
have a high prevalence of telomerase activity and a reduced need for a
telomere maintenance mechanism (low cell turnover), respectively. A yeast
model of ALT predicts that one of the five human RecQ helicases may be
required for ALT. Using the APB assay to test for the presence of ALT in
tumours from patients with known mutations in either WRN or RECQL4 it was
demonstrated that neither of these RecQ helicases is essential for ALT.
Although p53 and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins have been suggested to be
possible repressors of ALT, there was no apparent increase in the
frequency of ALT in tumours from patients with a germline mutation in p53
codon 273 or in colorectal carcinomas that had microsatellite instability
and thus MMR deficiency. Also contrary to being a repressor of ALT but
consistent with its ability to interact with a protein involved in the ALT
mechanism, the MMR protein MLH1, was demonstrated to be present in the
APBs of an ALT[+] cell line. To further test for genes that may be
involved in the ALT mechanism or associated with its activation, RNA
microarray was used to compare the gene expression of 12 ALT[+] with 12
matched telomerase[+] cell lines; 240 genes were identified that were
significantly differentially expressed (p<0.005) between the ALT[+] and
telomerase[+] cell lines. Only DRG2 and SFNX4 were significantly
differentially expressed after adjusting for the estimated false positive
rate. Overall, DRG2, MGMT and SATB1 were identified as most likely to be
relevant to the ALT[+] tumours and Western analysis indicated that DRG2
and MGMT levels were down-regulated after activation of ALT and up-
regulated after activation of telomerase, whereas SATB1 protein levels
appeared to be up-regulated after immortalisation but to a higher degree
with activation of ALT compared to telomerase. Since lack of MGMT is known
to be a determinant of temozolomide sensitivity in GBM, the possibility
that ALT and the APB assay could be used to predict temozolomide
sensitivity is discussed. The microarray data was consistent with MGMT
expression being suppressed by EGF (p < 0.05), indicating that caution may
be needed with combining EGFR inhibitors with temozolomide in ALT cancers.
One ALT[+] cell line which did not express MGMT had TTAA sequence in its
telomeres. This could possibly have resulted from mutations due to lack of
MGMT expression and a possible role for MGMT in the ALT mechanism is
discussed. Further analysis of the microarray data identified two groups
of co-regulated genes (p < 5x10-5): CEBPA, TACC2, SFXN4, HNRPK and MGMT,
and SIGIRR, LEF1, NSBP1 and SATB1. Two thirds of differentially expressed
genes were down-regulated in ALT. Chromosomes 10 and 15 had a bias towards
genes with lower expression in ALT while chromosomes 1, 4, 14 and X had a
bias towards genes with higher expression levels in ALT. This work has
developed a robust assay for ALT in tumour specimens which was then used
to show the significance of ALT in sarcomas, astrocytomas and NSCLC. It
has also identified genes that could possibly be molecular targets for the
treatment of ALT[+] cancers.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent muscular dystrophy
in children. It is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration
leading to muscle atrophy, disability and death around the 2nd decade of
life. The mdx mouse has been widely studied as an animal model of DMD
since it also presents progressive muscle degeneration. In DMD and in the
mdx mouse, the disease is the result of the absence of the dystrophin
protein under the sarcolemma, which translates into membrane instability
against mechanical stimulation of muscle contraction and therefore fiber
disruption. It should be noted that in the mouse dystrophy is less severe than
in the child. Affected mice present an almost normal survival compared to
unaffected mice. Nevertheless, the amount of damage to the tissue depends
on the muscle group and this is why the diaphragm is the most damaged muscle
and the most comparable to that of sick children. In
recent years, the study of treatments for DMD by means of stem cell
transplantation has increased considerably. The possibility of modulating
the activity/bioavailability of growth factors (eg, IGF, myostatin) and
the use of drugs is also being studied. All these studies aim to recover
damaged muscle tissue and that is why the working model has focused on
myoblasts and myofibers. However, an aggravating factor of DMD is the
presence and progressive increase of muscle fibrosis. Fibroblasts residing
in fibrotic tissues are, to a large extent, responsible for the deposition
of extracellular matrix (ECM). In the presence of damage, they are capable
of activating what involves greater proliferation, MEC synthesis and the
acquisition of a contractile phenotype. Activation responds to various
stimuli including mechanical stress, hormones, and growth factors present
in damaged tissue. Among the latter, the most studied up to now is the
transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta) that is able to induce the
synthesis and deposit of MEC. The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),
and very recently the growth factor derived from platelets type D (PDGF-D)
have also been studied. CTGF is present in different pathologies that
present with fibrosis but little is known about the role it plays in
skeletal muscle fibrosis. This factor responds to stimulation by TGF-13,
and it has been reported that both increase their expression in the muscle
tissue of the mdx mouse. However, the response to these factors in
fibroblasts isolated from skeletal muscle has not been reported. The study
of this cell group in muscular dystrophy is important since it is also a
target to be evaluated in therapies that favor muscle regeneration.

The research of fish cell culture has developed rapidly since 1960s when
Wolf and Quimby established the first fish cell line - RTG-2 - in the world.
At the present time, fish cell culturing has become an essential research
technology which has been used extensively, ranged from virology,
environmental toxicology, cytobiology, oncology, genomics, genetics and
environmental protection. Cultured fish cells have more advantages than
live fish as the experimental material: 1. the materials are cheap and
easy to obtain; 2. the experimental condition could be controlled
accurately and the experiment could be repeated. In the present study, the
culture methods of fish embryonic cell had been researched deeply. The
results were as follows. 1. Three embryonic cell lines had been
established: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) embryonic cell
line (FEC), turbot embryonic cell line (TEC) and Southern Flounder
embryonic cell line (SFEC). At the same time, a liver cell line of half-
smooth tongue-sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) (HTLC) was established. FEC
has been cultured for more than 100 passages and the same as the TEC. SFEC
has been cultured for more than 80 passages while HTLC has been cultured
for more than 30 passages. 2. The embryonic cells were cultured in DMEM
medium supplemented with antibiotics, fetal bovine serum (FBS), sea perch
serum (SPS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The HTLC cells were
cultured in MEM medium supplemented with antibiotics, fetal bovine serum
(FBS), sea perch serum (SPS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The
embryonic cells are small and polygon, rotundity. The liver cells of half-
smooth tongue-sole are fibriform. Effect of temperature, fetal bovine
serum (FBS) concentration and bFGF on the growth of cells was examined. To
some extent, the growth rate of cells depends on FBS concentration, and
can be restrained by higher or lower FBS concentration. Addition of bFGF
to the medium can significantly increase the growth rate of cells. The
cells grow well in at the temperature range of 24-30 Celsius, but have a
reduce growth rate at temperature below 18 Celsius or above 30 Celsius. 3.
Chromosome analysis reveals that FEC cells have a normal diploid karyotype
with 2n=48t; TEC cells have a normal diploid karyotype with 2n=4m+12st+28t;
SFEC cells have a normal diploid karyotype with 2n=6st+42t; HTLC cells
have a normal diploid karyotype with 2n=42t. Heterotypic sex chromosome
(ZW) was investigated on the metaphase chromosome of half-smooth tongue-
sole (female) and homotypic sex chromosome were investigated on the
metaphase chromosome of half-smooth tongue-sole (male). 4. GFP reporter
gene were transferred into SFEC and HTLC cells with Genejammer-mediated
and successfully expressed in two cell lines. The transformation
efficiency was about twenty percent. FEC cells were injected by Flounder
lymphocystis disease virus (LCV) and Turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBV).
Virus replicated rapidly in FEC and the cytopathic effect (CPE) was
investigated,. The mRNA expression levels of Hepcidin gene in TEC after
the challenge of Pichia pastoris were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
Sex-specific bands located on the W sex chromosome of females of half-
smooth tongue-sole by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.
In summary, the technology of establishing embryonic cell lines is founded.
it is the first time that FEC, TEC and SFEC were established in the world
while the HTLC was established by traditional method. Some research was
explored in the application of cell lines and laid foundation of using
cell lines to study theory and experiment.

Lung cancer continues to have by far the highest cancer mortality in the
UK. Beyond stage of disease and the patient's Performance Status there are
no other robust clinical or molecular markers of prognosis available today.
One major reason for the high mortality rate of this disease is the
significant proportion of patients who present with advanced incurable
stage disease. A second significant problem in the management of patients
with lung cancer is chemotherapy resistance. In patients with NSCLC (80%
of cases) initial response rates to cisplatin-based chemotherapy are
modest at best. In the case of SCLC (20% of cases) the initial response
rates to cisplatin-based chemotherapy are high. However relapse, often
with chemotherapy resistant disease, is all too common.

There is a significant body of evidence that demonstrates the role of the
loss of mismatch repair activity in the mechanism of chemotherapy
resistance. Studies to date have demonstrated that the loss of mismatch
repair protein expression is a consequence of 2 main mechanisms: gene
mutation and the epigenetic phenomenon of methylation of the MLH1 (a major
mismatch repair protein) gene promoter region. Studies have shown that the
loss of MLH1 expression is associated with acquired resistance in ovarian
and breast cancers. Allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity) of
chromosome 3p is common in lung cancer samples and the MLH1 gene locus
resides here. This loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been demonstrated to
be a poor prognostic indicator in patients with primary adenocarcinoma of
the lung. In this translational research project the role of mismatch
repair (MMR) and LOH in patients with lung cancer has been further
investigated. In the first study using 2 separate cohorts of patients the
potential role of mismatch repair proteins as a marker of prognosis in
patients with NSCLC was investigated.

The first cohort of patients had received either cisplatin based or non-
cisplatin based chemotherapy for predominantly advanced (stage IIIb/IV)
disease at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. Pre-treatment paraffin-embedded
bronchoscopic samples were collected retrospectively. The aims of this
study were to examine the level of expression of the MLH1, MSH2, p53 and
Ki67 proteins in these small samples and assess whether these results
correlated with any clinicopathological variables or with prognosis. In
addition differences in overall survival between the cisplatin and the non-
cisplatin chemotherapy treated patients were assessed relative to the
level of protein expression. Despite the small size of the biopsies good
inter-observer kappa scores were demonstrated between 2 independent
scorers for each protein immunohistochemistry score (IHC) (MLH1 -0.6062,
MSH2 -0.4313, p53 -0.591). Although this demonstrates that historic
bronchoscopy samples can be used for such studies, the number of markers
studied was limited due to small sample size and in this study there was
insufficient tissue to assess expression levels of Ki67. No significant
correlations were demonstrated between IHC score and overall survival for
any of the proteins studied, nor was there any difference between the
different chemotherapy regimens. Similarly there was no correlation
between IHC score of the studied proteins and any clinicopathological
variables.

The second cohort of patients all had resection of their primary NSCLC
tumour at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Of these 50 patients, 10 had received
pre-operative cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Fresh frozen surgical samples
collected at the time of surgery were analysed retrospectively. The aims
of this study were to examine the level of expression of the MLH1, MSH2,
p53 and Ki67 proteins in these samples and assess whether these results
correlated with any clinicopathological variables or prognosis. Whether
any difference existed in these variables between the patients receiving
pre-operative chemotherapy and those that did not was also investigated.
This study failed to show any significant correlation between the level of
protein expression and overall survival or any other clinicopathological
variable. Further there was no difference in the level of protein
expression between those patients who had received pre-operative
chemotherapy and those who had not. However given that only a small number
of patients had received pre-operative chemotherapy, further large studies
would be required to validate these results.

In the second study we investigated the status of CpG island methylation
(using methylation specific PCR) and its role as a marker of prognosis in
patients with NSCLC. The samples were the same surgical samples as
described above as well as normal adjacent lung tissue. The markers
studied were MLH1, p16, DAPK, TIMP 3, HIC 1, MINT 25, MINT 31 and RASSF1A.
In this study 30 (60%) of samples exhibited methylation of at least one
promoter site with 19 (38%) at 1 site, 5 (10%) at 2 sites, 2 (4%) at 3
sites and 4 (8%) at 4 sites. Twenty (40%) of the tumour samples exhibited
no methylation at any promoter sites. Methylation rates in normal adjacent
lung tissue were low. There was no significant correlation between the
number of methylated sites and either overall survival or any other
studied clinicopathological variable. The investigation of methylation at
individual sites demonstrated an association between HIC 1 methylation and
stage of disease (p = 0.020) and methylation of MINT 31 was associated
with a better overall survival (P = 0.030). This remained the case when
analysis was performed excluding those patients who had received pre-
operative chemotherapy. This is the first report of MINT 31 methylation
being studied in NSCLC and therefore further independent studies would be
required to validate these results and confirm that the associations had
not occurred by chance due to multiple testing. No significant differences
in any of the studied variables were demonstrated when comparing patients
who had received pre-operative chemotherapy with those who had not.

A third study was performed to validate the findings of previous studies
that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 3p is a common occurrence
in patients with NSCLC (Mitsudomi et al., 1996). This study also aimed to
investigate any correlations between 3p LOH (D3S1289, D3S1300, D3S1304) or
hMLH1 promoter methylation and level of MLH1 expression. In addition this
study attempted to correlate the presence of any molecular changes found
in the serum DNA taken preoperatively from patients with those of their
primary tumour samples. For this study prospective collection of surgical
tumour and normal adjacent lung tissue samples as well as a pre-operative
whole blood sample was collected from patients undergoing resection of
their primary disease at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. Numbers in this
study were small thus making any attempt at statistical analysis
inappropriate. Observations demonstrated that 3p LOH was common in the
primary tumour with 4/8 samples demonstrating LOH at D3S1289, 5/6 at
D3S1300 and 5/9 at D3S1304. Corresponding changes were demonstrated in the
preoperative serum samples in 2 of the 4 patients at D3S1289, 3/5 at
D3S1300 and 2/5 at D3S1304. Loss of Heterozygosity at chromosome 3p did
not appear to affect the level of MLH1 expression and hMLH1 methylation
was not demonstrated in any of the studied tumour samples.

A final study, in collaboration with Dr J Plumb, was performed to
investigate the role of the mismatch repair proteins in the chemotherapy
sensitivity of a panel of small cell lung cancer cell lines. In this study
it was demonstrated that there was a high correlation between cisplatin
sensitivity and the mismatch repair proteins MLH1 (r2 = 0.83) and MSH2 (r2
= 0.87) but not PMS2 (r2 = 0.22). Two of the cell lines originated from
metastatic biopsies from the same patient, one pre-chemotherapy treatment
(LS274) and one post-chemotherapy (LS310). It was shown that LS310 is 2.3
times more resistant to cisplatin and shows a 50% reduction in MLH1
expression when compared to LS274 (p < 0.001). It was demonstrated that
the hMLH1 promoter region of LS310 exhibited methylation whereas the LS274
promoter region did not. Neither of these lines exhibited methylation of
the p16, MINT 25 or DAPK loci suggesting that de novo methylation was not
responsible for the methylation specific PCR results. Further work
demonstrated that treatment of the LS310 cell line with the demethylating
agent decitabine increased its cisplatin sensitivity as well as increasing
the level of MLH1 expression of the cell line. No such changes were
demonstrated in the LS274 cell line after treatment with decitabine.

In summary, this research project was limited by the availability of
samples. However it has demonstrated that collaborative multidisciplinary
prospective planned translational research can be done and emphasises the
need for a translational component to be an integral part of future lung
cancer studies.

Neural cell lines have been extremely useful for elucidating mechanisms of
neural cell function, regeneration and disease for mammalian species.
Despite the widely known regenerative capability of neural tissues in many
aquatic organisms, few cell lines have been derived from neural tissues of
aquatic species. In this study, we report on a newly established neural
cell line from goldfish cerebellum (GFB3C) and compare growth
characteristics in response to various parameters (temperature,
osmolality, nutritional supplements, growth/differentiation factors and
response to metals) with an aquatic invertebrate cell line (OLGA-PH-J/92)
derived from the cerebral ganglia of crayfish. Both goldfish and crayfish
have been used as model organisms to study neuronal function and survival
in polluted waters. The OLGA cell line grew best at 27 Celsius whereas
GFB3C grew well at 22-30 Celsius. For both cell lines, best growth was
observed in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum, compared to other common mammalian or insect culture medias. OLGA
grew best at lower osmolalities than GFB3C cells, which was inconsistent
with their freshwater invertebrate origins. Addition of glucose (L-15
contains galactose), or growth factors did not affect growth of either
cell line. Formation of neurospheres, a characteristic of neural stem
cells was also investigated. OLGA cells did not form neurospheres, whereas
GFB3C did quite readily.

Immunostaining revealed that both cell lines consisted primarily of glial
cells as positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, a glial
cell marker, was found. The cells were tested for differentiation
capabilities using retinoic acid or adhesion to poly-L-lysine as
differentiation agents. Neuronal like cellular processes could be induced
when GFB3C neurospheres were plated onto poly-L-lysine coated plates.
Finally, in terms of toxicity, both cell lines were highly tolerant to
metal exposure, which correlates with their in vivo behavior. Both could
be useful for understanding mechanisms of neural growth and
differentiation in vertebrate and invertebrate species as well as in
toxicity response and resistance in aquatic animals.

possibility of their use for virological studies of fish. To achieve this
goal, it was necessary to solve the following tasks: to explant and
maintain for a long time the cells of the ovarian tissue of carp,
parenchymal organs and fins of Siberian sturgeon in their primary culture
for use as a starting material in the production of transfected cell lines.
We establishd a transplantable line of ovary cells of immature carp,
transplantable cell lines of a pool of parenchymal organs and fins of
Siberian sturgeon, we determined the sensitivity of the resulting cell
lines to widespread fish viruses of different taxonomic groups, we carred

Cobalamin must be metabolized intracellularly in order to bind two
enzymes: methionine synthase in cytoplasm and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in
mitochondria. Defects in this process cause different inborn errors of
cobalamin metabolism (cblA-cblG and mut). A previous study described a
cobalamin-binding protein, in addition to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, in
crude mitochondrial fractions. The amount of [57Co]cobalamin bound to this
protein was increased in cblB, mut and cblD variant cell lines, compared
to control cell lines. In the present study, this protein was identified
as transcobalamin (TC). Mitochondrial fractions from a cblB cell line were
incubated with anti-TC antibodies, which precipitated the cobalamin-bound
protein. Analysis of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions isolated from
a chloroquine-incubated cblF cell line showed that isolated mitochondrial
fractions contain lysosomal material, suggesting that the identified TC is
lysosomal. Quantification of cobalamin-bound TC levels in whole cell
extracts showed significant increases in cblB and mut groups compared to
control cell lines.

Inherited retinal dystrophies and age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
are leading causes of blindness. Current treatments only slow disease
progression in a minority of patients, therefore it is important to
develop new treatments that can regenerate lost cells, restore retinal
function and halt disease progression. Retinal progenitor cells have the
potential to replace degenerating photoreceptors in retinal diseases. This
thesis explores the viability of using immortalised human foetal retinal
progenitor cells for this purpose, and aims to elucidate the trophic
factors required, in vitto, to drive these cells towards retinal cell
lineages. We also examine their potential to survive, integrate and
differentiate in the diseased and developing rat retina. Two human foetal
retinal progenitor cell lines were established by infecting retinal foetal
tissue with the temperature-sensitive tsT-SV40 antigen. The immortalised
progenitor cells were compared to primary human foetal retinal progenitor
cultures, and both were shown to express similar markers of neural
progenitor cells and early neuronal cell types. Several trophic factors
were investigated, including serum, retinoic acid and conditioned medium,
with respect to their ability to influence gene expression. Serum appeared
to induce expression of ganglion cell markers, and conditioned medium
stimulated cell proliferation. Cells were also grafted into neonatal
hooded Lister rats and RCS dystrophic rats, and neither the primary nor
the immortalised progenitor cells demonstrated integration into the retina.
In the RCS rat, cells were engulfed by host macrophage/microglia and
showed no signs of integration or expression of neuronal markers.
Immortalised cells, in vivo, stained positively for Ki67 and low levels of
nestin, but exhibited limited abitity to differentiate or integrate. These
data indicate that immortalised progenitor cells maintain many
characteristics of unimmortalised progenitor cells, and suggest that
immortalisation of retinal progenitors may have long term therapeutic
possibilities.

Bacteria Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of intestinal enteritisov.
The method of infection with C.jejuni represents the ingestion of
contaminated food, especially poor heat-treated chicken meat, fresh milk
and contaminated water. We have studied intracellular survive, adhesion
and invasion of bacteria in chicken intestinal cells. The results show,
that the highest adhesion and invasion in the chicken intestinal
epithelial B1OXI cells of Campylobacter are after 10 hours of infection.
In PSI pig cells, has C.jejuni the highest adhesion and invasion at the
short-term exposure to atmospheric concentrations of oxygen, or when they
are not exposed to stressful conditions. The potential in adhesion
bacteria is negative, or is close to 0 volts. In invasion cells is the
highest by the dilutions after 10 hours of infection. Results in
experiments with the pig cells show, that C. jejuni has a small changes in
TER after 10 hours infection. When we did not use gentamicin we can find
the bacteria 24 hours after infection. We can say, that the chickens do
not suffer with the bacteria C.jejuni such as pigs, but they are only
carriers of this disease.

The discovery of oncogenes, tumor suppressors and susceptibility genes
have demonstrated that cancer is related to changes in the genome.
However, the wide variety of molecular alterations observed among inter
and intra tumor types greatly difficults the development of effective
anticancer therapies and appropriate biomarkers for the early selection of
patients. In this work, we describe the establishment of different panels
of cell lines derived from human tumor samples. Due to their low passage
number, these cell lines retained part of the molecular characteristics
found in the original tumor. This system represented a suitable model to
perform pharmacogenomic studies that help to envisage future clinical
responses. Using this cell panel, we carried out comparative studies
between the expression profiles of different genes commonly altered in
cancer and their response to different drugs currently used in clinical
oncology. In addition, using validated bio-informatic tools, we generated
data matrices that helped us to identify putative response biomarkers for
three new marine-derived antitumor drugs -Yondelis, Aplidin and Zalypsis -
developed by the Spanish biopharmaceutical company PharmaMar. On studying
the relationship between the sensitivity of the different cell lines to
Yondelis and the expression of the selected biomarkers, we observed a
highly significant correlation between the presence or absence of p53 and
its sensibility to the drug. Dose-response functional analyses using
isogenic cell lines expressing or not p53, showed that the absence of p53
consistently increased the sensibility to Yondelis. In addition, we
demonstrated that the drug induced the accumulation of p53, although it
was not associated with the transcription of its known target genes Bax or
p21CIP1. On the other hand, we observed a p53 dependent MAPK/ERK kinase
activation. Concerning Aplidin, we observed a significant correlation
between the cells sensibility to the drug and low expression levels of
p27KIP1. Furthermore, cell lines with knocked-down p27KIP1 or null MEFs
were much more sensitive to Aplidin than their respective wild-type
counterparts. Also, we observed that Aplidin increased the cellular
content of p27KIP1 by an oxidation-dependent mechanism, as demonstrated by
the inhibition of the Aplidin-induced increase in p27KIP1 levels by the
addition of antioxidants. Finally, regarding Zalypsis, we found a clear
relationship between the sensibility to the drug and low levels of
PDGFRalpha in both in vitro and in vivo in xenotransplantes models. In
summary, our results suggest p53, p27KIP1 and PDGFRalpha as predictive
response biomarkers for the new antitumor drugs Yondelis, Aplidin and
Zalypsis, respectively.

Prostate cell lines were derived from two regions of prostate tissue from
the same patient. The objective was to produce cell lines (as a useful in
vitro model) from these two different regions which exhibit different
properties for carcinoma development. The tissue was obtained from
patients suffering from benign prostate hyperplasia undergoing trans-
urethral resection. Tissue was taken from the deep (peripheral) and
superficial (peri-urethral) areas. The cells were immortalised by
transduction with constructs over expressing the cdk4 and hTERT genes.
These cell lines were then characterised for their cellular phenotypes
utilized for radiation transformation studies and utilized to investigate
the role of plant derived polyphenols on normal and tumour cells.

The cell line from the superficial region (P21s) was treated to
fractionated doses of gamma radiation and a transformed cloned cell line
was derived (P21s 40Gy (clone-a)). The cell line from the deep region
(P21d) was found to consist of a mixed population of abnormal cells and a
transformed cloned cell line was derived from it (P21d 40Gy (clone-a). In
an attempt to obtain a normal P21d cell line cloned cell lines from early
passage P21d cells were established. All seven cloned lines were abnormal
with an average of 80 chromosomes per cell, invasive using a Matrigel
assay and produced anchorage independent colonies. All cell lines were
fully characterised with immunocytochemistry, chromosome analysis,
invasion assays, and anchorage independent colony formation. P21s
expressed basal cell markers (cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and 14), were positive
for stem cell markers (prostate specific stem cell antigen PSCA, CK6),
positive for p16, p63 and telomerase expression and negative for c-Myc
expression. P21s was not invasive in a Matrigel assay and did not produce
anchorage independent colony formation. P21d and P21d 40Gy (clone-a) also
expressed CK5, CK14, PSCA, CK6, and telomerase but not p16 or p63 and
showed an increase in expression of nuclear c-Myc, highly invasive and
produced anchorage independent colonies. P21s 40Gy (clone-a) expressed
CK5, CK14, PSCA, CK6, telomerase and p63, produced anchorage independent
colonies, and was weakly positive for c-Myc expression.

Spectral karyotyping analysis (SKY) showed P21s had a normal chromosome
complement except an additional chromosome 20 whereas the P21s 40Gy
(clone-a), P21d and P21d 0Gy (clone-a) cell lines had an abnormal chromosome
complement with P21d and P21d 0Gy (clone-a) cell lines expressing multiple
copies of every chromosome including loss of the Y chromosome. These
results were echoed in the single nucleotide polymorphism chip (SNP)
results which showed P21s as normal but P21d and P21d 40Gy (clone-a) to
have large deletion and amplification regions that correlated with the SKY
analysis.

No differential cytotoxic response was noted between normal and abnormal
cell lines including prostatic carcinoma cell lines LNCaP and PC-3
following treatment with strawberry polyphenol compounds. Most reports of
a cytotoxic response to tumour cells in the literature did not compare the
response to normal cells and used established cell lines. Human
lymphocytes were also tested and all compounds were toxic in high doses.
Polyphenol and ellagitannin rich polyphenol fractions were very cytotoxic
and the anthocyanin rich fraction less toxic. In contrast to the lack of a
direct differential cytotoxic effect, plant polyphenols did produce a
protective effect to a carcinogenic insult. However a protective effect
was noted via micronucleus assay with 3 hour incubation with the
polyphenol rich fraction prior to radiation treatment. Finally, the
expression and association of metabolic enzymes within the cells cytosol
were investigated. The P21s cells were found to express both isoforms of
LDH and so thought to be able to metabolise anaerobically and aerobically.
P21d and P21d 40Gy (clone-a) cells were found to only express one isoform
in the complex and so it was assumed that these cells favoured anaerobic
metabolism of ATP in correlation to the Warburg effect. c-Myc association
with compounds in the cell cytosol of P21s cells existed whereas, abnormal
cells lost this association along with up-regulation of c-Myc expression
and down stream targets of c-Myc in the nuclei.

Thus these newly established human prostate cell lines provide a useful
model system for investigating the biology of the prostate and prostate
cancer.

RTgutGC showed optimal growth in L15 supplemented with 10-20% fetal bovine

Exposure of LPS was compared between RTgutGC and two mammalian intestinal

People are getting older. Increased life expectancy puts diseases such as
cancer in the foreground. A particularly aggressive and malignant form is
pancreatic carcinoma, in which tens of thousands of people die every year
in industrialized countries despite the most intensive treatment. Current
tumor therapies such as resection, radiation, chemotherapy and
combinations thereof do not or only to a very limited extent. The mean
survival rate for the first year is 20% and only 1% of the patients
survive the 5th year after diagnosis. Without treatment, death occurs on
average 3-6 months after diagnosis. Especially the almost inauspicious
prognosis and the bad treatability let research oncologists worldwide for
new therapies. One approach to this is the 'starvation' of cancer cells.
Due to the enormous iron requirement of proliferating cells, it seems
reasonable to suppose that by reducing iron uptake into the cell, it can
cause it to shrink. Exactly this approach is described in the present
work. Both in vitro and in vivo, it was tested whether one can achieve a
positive effect by an antibody therapy against the transferrin receptor,
which infiltrates iron into the cell.

Mutations in the 'MMACHC' gene cause 'cblC', the most common inborn error
of cobalamin metabolism, with approximately 400 known cases. It results in
the inability to convert vitamin B12 (cobalamin) into its two active
coenzyme forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, required by
methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase respectively. It can be
characterized according to age of onset, with early onset patients
presenting within the first year of life with a number of pathologies and
later onset patients presenting after the age of four with predominantly
neurological symptoms. Individuals with the c.394C>T (p.R132X) as well as
a number of missense mutations generally have later onset of disease
whereas patients with the c.331C>T (p.R111X) and c.271dupA (p.R91KfsX14)
mutations usually present in infancy. Expression experiments measuring
allele-specific transcripts and quantitative real-time RT-PCR measuring
overall 'MMACHC' transcript amount revealed increased transcription from
alleles bearing late onset related mutations when compared to early onset
mutation-bearing alleles. Understanding the mechanisms underlying early
and late onset of disease may improve treatment and prognosis for 'cblC'
patients.

In this study, establishment of HL-CZ (a promonocytic cell line) as a new

We performed microarray gene expression profiling to compare HL-CZ cells

conditions versus HL-CZ cells infected to an equivalent degree but under
non-enhancing conditions. We observed differential expression of several
genes belonging to the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases (DDX). These
observations were confirmed at a protein level by immunoblotting for these
proteins in cell lysates obtained from infected cells. Subsequent
experiments employing siRNA-mediated knock-down of protein expression
suggested that DDX31 and DDX47 may be crucial in supporting infection of
dengue virus under ADE conditions.

Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, composed of tumour cells with
differing gene expressions and phenotypes. Tumour heterogeneity has
several important consequences for breast cancer including: (i) making
classification by morphological and expression analysis more difficult
because of the diversity within single tumours with the consequence that
the majority of cells of the tumour will dominate this classification
whether or not these cells are critical for diagnosis or treatment; (ii)
treatments may fail to eradicate tumours simply by failing to eliminate
one of the cell subtypes within the tumour; and (iii) differing abilities
of the cell subtypes for dissemination and metastasis. Recently, a rare
subpopulation of cells within tumours has been described with the ability
to initiate and sustain tumour growth, to resist traditional therapies and
to allow for secondary tumour dissemination. These cells are termed tumour-
initiating cells or cancer stem cells, or alternatively, in the case of
breast cancer, breast cancer stem cells. The therapeutic targeting of
these cells has the potential to eliminate residual disease and may become
an important component of a multi-modality treatment of cancer. Presented
here is an investigation into: (i) ways to functionally and phenotypically
identify breast cancer stem cells; (ii) the role of breast cancer stem
cells in disease from both clinical samples and using xenograft assays;
and (iii) the potential to target these cells.

Stem cell based therapies offer hope for the treatment of retinal disease.
In the mammalian retina, Muller glia possess some stem cell-like
characteristics. However, their capacity for neurogenesis remains limited.
To identify factors influencing the neurogenic potential of Muller glia in
vitro, a conditionally immortalized mouse Muller cell line (ImM10) was
generated and characterized. In addition to Muller glial genes, ImM10
cells express some genes characteristic of retinal progenitor cells.
Following treatment with specific growth factors and media supplements, a
subset of Muller glia acquired a more neuronal morphology and expressed
neuronal genes. To determine the role of environment on Muller glia
derived neurogenesis, Muller glia were cultured in three dimensional (3D)
peptide hydrogels. Cells encapsulated within 3D hydrogels expressed
different neuronal genes, compared to cells cultured on 2D flat plastic
substrates. The roles of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) and
Notch signaling in Muller glia derived neurogenesis were also investigated.
REST represses neuronal genes in nonneuronal tissues, whereas Notch can
promote gliogenesis during retinal development. Inhibition of Rest
expression by RNA interference combined with pharmacological inhibition of
Notch signaling with DAPT led to the upregulation of some additional
neuronal genes in ImM10 Muller glia. Together, these results demonstrated
a modest neurogenic capacity for Muller glia. A potential barrier for
transplantation of these or any stem-like cells for therapeutic purposes
is retinal remodeling of surviving cells following retinal disease or
injury. Neuronal and synaptic remodeling was analyzed in the rd10 mouse
model of retinitis pigmentosa. Following photoreceptor degeneration,
second order neurons (horizontal, and bipolar cells) showed dendrite
retraction, cellular migration, and a loss of post-synaptic elements that
increased with disease progression. Surprisingly, the inner retina
remained relatively intact even at advanced stages of degeneration.
Furthermore, survival of small numbers of cone photoreceptors preserved
second-order neuronal circuitry locally. This study suggests that the
inner retina may remain receptive to interventions even at late stages of
disease, and that early cellular transplantation may help prevent or slow
retinal remodeling.

Pluripotent cells are unique due to their developmental potential and the
possibility to study them is the key step to understand human development.
These cells are characterized by their ability to originate all the
cellular lineages within an adult organism. Within embryonic milieu,
pluripotent cells represent a dynamic fraction of the total cell number.
Moreover, their physiological existence is constrained to early stages of
embryonic development. In vitro culture of the different types of
mammalian pluripotent cells, and singularly embryonic stem cells (ESC),
enables the characterization of the pluripotent state. In the four articles
included in this thesis we have addressed two different aspects of the
molecular characterization of mammalian pluripotent cells. First, we
investigated the establishment of the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass
in the embryo measuring transcript abundance and protein presence of the
transcription factors known to play a role in the earliest cellular
differentiation process. In addition we have evaluated of genomic stability
of human ESC lines during long-term culture, observing the accumulation of
subkaryotypic aberrations such as loss of heterozygosity that affect
loci comprising genes involved in genomic stability maintenance. We also
checked the genomic status of two human ESC lines derived from embryos that
had been diagnosed as abnormal after genetic preimplantation diagnosis
(PGD). The molecular analysis of these cells ruled out the
hypothesized self-correction of the aneuploidies between the PGD and the
establishment of the cell lines.

This Thesis was made with the intention to mechanistically assess and
further develop a multi-stage cell line-based (in vitro) model for oral
cancer development. Efforts of establishing additional tumor cell lines
for expanding the model were coupled with the application of systems
biology technologies for characterization of the three entities of the
start-up model, including: 1) normal, 2) immortal and non-tumorigenic,
versus 3) immortal and tumorigenic stages. Omics data integration from
assessment of cell lines as unique entities, and model-driven in vitro
manipulations formed the basis for construction of two bioinformatics
based pipelines for this task. Altered phenotypic and genotypic
characteristics and the event of non-functional cell differentiation (a
hallmark of cancer development) was analyzed broadly among the transformed
stages of the model relative the normal counterpart, testing the
overarching hypothesis that thorough analysis of cell line data might
contribute clinically useful tumor biomarkers potentially hidden in
existing genome-wide assessments of clinical tissue samples. The
separate papers forming the Thesis, in order, generated: 1) a review of
existing data from the start-up model under a selected standardized serum-free
condition, 2) an omics-integrative tumor biomarker discovery pipeline
based on the start-up model, 3) a model-driven tumor biomarker discovery
pipeline based on assessment of influences of confluency (high cell
density and cell-to-cell contact) in the seemingly most differentiation-
deficient cell line in the start-up model, 4) a novel tumor cell line
applicable to expand the number of serum-free entities of the model, 5) an
expanded model-driven tumor biomarker discovery pipeline based on
assessment of serum-induced influences of the extended model (now with
four entities), and finally, 6) an analysis of the novel cell line under a
further expanded omics-integrative tumor biomarker discovery pipeline. The
overall results included broad description of the multiple alterations at
gene, pathway and ontology levels that coupled with the transformed
phenotypes and non-functional cell differentiation in the cell line models.
The bioinformatics-driven assessment using overall six different
processing tools of differential expression of 44 proteins and thousands
of transcripts from these analyses suggested multiple potential biomarker
signatures in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Overall, five in
vitro-based signatures could be validated for clinical significance in
independent data from tumor tissue analysis, including multiple oral and
non-oral patient data sets as well as body-wide transcriptomics and
proteomics expression databases. The taken approaches elucidated basic
mechanisms of cell transformation while simultaneously generating
paradigms/protocols generally applicable to cancer biomarker discovery.
Proving the hypothesis under testing, the results show that the in vitro-
derived biomarkers are complementary, often with superior accuracy, to
those generated from direct assessment of cancer tissue specimens.
Overall, the application of technologies and methods as described possibly
generated a first description of an 'in vitro systems biology model of
oral cancer development' with potential for wide further application in
experimental and translational research.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is an essential coenzyme in mammals for two
reactions: the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme
methionine synthase and the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-
CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. In cells, cobalamin is
converted to the two active coenzyme forms of the vitamin: methylcobalamin
and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. Eight groups of patients have been
described with intracellular disorders of cobalamin metabolism, named cblA-
cblG and mut. Three groups of patients present with an inability to
produce both methylcobalamin and 5'deoxyadenosylcobalamin: cblF, cblC and
cblD. We located the gene responsible for the cblF type of cobalamin
disorder to chromosome 6 by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer,
leading to the discovery of the LMBRD1 gene. We identified three novel
mutations in LMBRD1 among cblF patients. We reviewed phenotypic and
genetic data on three cblD patients and were able to confirm previous
genotype-phenotype correlations. We purified the MMADHC protein defective
in the cblD group of cobalamin disorder and predicted that interactions
with the protein defective in the cblC group occur in a domain homologous
to a bacterial domain involved also in protein-protein interactions.

We previously identified FERM domain containing 4A (FRMD4A) protein as a
human epidermal stem cell marker that is upregulated in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We now show that FRMD4A is strongly
expressed in SCC, regardless of differentiation status. Knockdown of
FRMD4A decreases growth and metastasis of SCC xenografts in skin and
tongue. It reduces SCC proliferation and intercellular adhesion and
stimulates caspase-3 activity and terminal differentiation. FRMD4A
knockdown causes nuclear accumulation of YAP, indicating a role in Hippo
pathway signalling. Treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG or ligation
of CD44 with hyaluronan, which cause nuclear depletion of FRMD4A and
nuclear accumulation of YAP, reduce growth and metastasis of SCC
xenografts. We conclude that targeting FRMD4A offers a promising new
approach to treating SCC. Our results show that characterising normal
tissue stem cells can provide unexpected insights into the malignant state.

In Southeast Asia, the intensification of aquaculture industry has led to
the occurrence of various infectious diseases. Virus diseases in
particular, affecting especially the larval and juvenile stages, are the
most suppressing factors for sustainable production of high value fish
species such as seabass (Lates ca/carifer). Inevitable, because of lack of
sensitive methods that could be used for diagnosis and the inadequacy of
pathogen control, the aquaculture industry will continue to be plagued by
these diseases. Currently, viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is one of fish
diseases listed by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) as a
notifiable disease in the production of marine fish worldwide. Thus the
main objective of the present study was to determine the role of VNN virus
(VNNv) as a pathogen in the Malaysian aquaculture industry, with emphasis
on virus isolation in susceptible cell line, virus identification using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identification of characteristic
microscopy lesions in VNNv infections. A new cell line designated as Asian
Seabass Brain (ASBB-1) was derived from the brain tissue of seabass
cultured in Malaysia. This cell line was maintained in Leibovitz L-15
media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The ASBB-1 cell line
was sub-cultured more than 60 times over a period of 15 months. This cell
line consists predominantly of fibroblastic-like cells, which are able to
grow at temperatures between 20C and 30C with an optimum temperature of
25 Celsius. At 25C, the growth rate of these cells increased as the
proportion of FBS increased from 5 to 20% with optimum growth at 15% or
10% FBS. The ASBB-1 cell line was characterized by karyotyping, and
chromosome number distributions were different with subcultures P20 and
P50 producing 48 and 46 chromosome peaks respectively. The ASBB-1 cells
showed 90% viability after recovery from one year storage in liquid
nitrogen. The ASBB-1 cells up on characterization by peR using primer sets
of microsatellite markers of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) were shown
to be similar to the cells from tissues of seabass at 250 bp. The VNNv
isolate derived from seabass was tested positive for VNN by the 102000 Kit.
The isolate designated UPM08-1 M was used in the cell line infectivity
study. The susceptibilities of ASBB-1 cell line isolate and the highly
permissive commercial SSN-1 cells to UPM08-1 M were compared. The results
showed that ASBB-1 cell line was susceptible to VNNv (RGNNV genotype) with
typical cytopathic effect (CPE) manifesting mainly as rounding-up at1 day
post infection (dpi), severe vacuolation within 3-5dpi and complete
detachment within 7dpi. The VNNv-induced CPE was further elucidated by
electron microscopy (EM). Under EM, the ASBB-1cells exhibited vacuolated
degeneration with presence of viral inclusion-like bodies. The CPE of VNNv
on ASBB-1cells was producedat a virus titer of 109.5 TCID50/ml. This
indicated that the ASBB-1 cell line is highly susceptible for use in the
isolation of VNNv. Biophysical and biochemical characterization of VNNv
isolate was determined by heat treatment, UV irradiation and the stability
under effect of chemical disinfectants. The VNNv isolate showed
susceptibility to heat treatment at 60 Celsius within 30 minutes with no
viable virus after 1 hour. UV irradiation at an intensity of 440 mWrcm2
resulted in a reduction in virus titer after 8 minutes. The virus appeared
relatively resistant to changes in pH ranging between 2 to 11 after 1 hour
incubation at 25 Celsius. Treatment with 2% formalin was not totally
effective even after 6 hours. Iodine did not inactivate the virus.
Molecular characterization of the tissue culture-propagated virus using
RT-PCR and nested PCR, showed positive amplifications of genome size of 460
bp and 220 bp respectively. The 220 bp nucleotides from the T4 region of
the coat protein gene was sequenced and the phylogenetic analysis results
showed close resemblance between the UPM08-1 M strain and SBNNV and GPNNV2
strains of Malaysian isolates. The local isolate of UPM08-1 M also showed
phylogenetic similarity with other strains from South East Asia, while
showed relatively distant similarity with other VNNv strains from the
Middle East. Cold water VNNv strains isolated from Norway, Canada and USA
were distant phylogenetic relations to the UPM08-1 M strain. Experimental
infectivity study was also performed using fresh water guppy fish
(Poecilia reticulata) as a model. Guppies were intranasally infected with
0.1 ml of the UPM08-1M strain at a titre of 109.5 TCID5010.1ml. Although
the artificial infection resulted in slight mortality (11%) occurring
within 14 days post inoculation, the VNN-specific lesions such as necrosis
and vacuolation in the target organs of brain and retina were evident. The
presence of virus in infected brain and retina tissues was confirmed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The VNNv from experimentally
infected guppy was successfully reisolated in ASBB-1 cells inoculated with
homogenate of brain and retinas of the survivors. There was gradual
increment of virus titer in the guppy throughout the experimental period.
The results indicated that guppy fish could be infected with VNNv isolated
from diseased seabass. In summary, the study successfully isolated VNNv
using the ASBB-1 cell line. Complete CPE of this cell line was observed
within 5 -7 dpi after infection with VNNv at producing considerable higher
titer of 1095TCID5010.1ml. Thus ASBB-1 cells can be recommended for VNNv
(RGNNV genotype) isolation and will be an important tool for future
conduct of fish health assurance programs in the aquaculture industry. The
study also showed that RT-PCR followed by nested-PCR is a sensitive
technique for identification of VNNv isolated from sea bass. It was also
shown that guppy fish could be experimentally infected with VNNv, thus can
be used as a virus-infection model.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is an essential cofactor for two human
enzymes: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) and methionine synthase (MTR). MUT
utilizes 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) to convert methylmalonyl-CoA
to succinyl-CoA in the mitochondria, whereas MTR utilizes methylcobalamin
(MeCbl) to convert homocysteine to methionine in the cytoplasm. To date,
eight complementation groups (cblA-G and mut), each the result of
mutations at a different gene, have been discovered to be involved in the
intracellular metabolism of cobalamin. A patient presented at birth,
following an abnormal newborn screen, with hypotonia, lethargy, poor
feeding and bone marrow suppression. There were elevated levels of
methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, suggestive of a defect in vitamin B12
metabolism. Studies of cultured fibroblast showed decreased function of
the cobalamin-dependent enzymes, MTR and MUT. There was increased uptake
of labelled cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) but decreased synthesis of the
cobalamin cofactors MeCbl and AdoCbl, with accumulation of "free" (i.e.
non-protein bound) CNCbl in the cells. The cellular phenotype mimicked
that of the cblF disorder caused by mutations in the LMBRD1 gene encoding
the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1 that is thought to play a role in
transfer of cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane into the cytoplasm.
However, cells from the patient complemented those from all known
complementation groups, including cblF, and no mutations in LMBRD1 were
found. Whole-exome sequencing led to the identification of two mutations
in the ABCD4 gene: c.956A>G (p.Y319C) and c.1746_1747insCT (p.E583LfsX9).
Two additional patients with deleterious ABCD4 mutations were later found.
Transfection of patient fibroblasts with wild type ABCD4 led to rescue of
all abnormal cellular phenotypes. This thesis reports that this novel
disorder, named cblJ, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by
mutations in ABCD4. The findings suggest that ABCD4, an ABC half-
transporter, is another essential component of intracellular cobalamin
metabolism.

Mathematical models, that depict the dynamics of a cancer cell population
growing out of the human body (in vitro) in unconstrained microenvironment
conditions, are considered in this thesis. Cancer cells in vitro grow and
divide much faster than cancer cells in the human body, therefore, the
effects of various cancer treatments applied to them can be identified
much faster. These cell populations, when not exposed to any cancer
treatment, exhibit exponential growth that we refer to as the balanced
exponential growth (BEG) state. This observation has led to several
effective methods of estimating parameters that thereafter are not
required to be determined experimentally.

We present derivation of the age-structured model and its theoretical
analysis of the existence of the solution. Furthermore, we have obtained
the condition for BEG existence using the Perron-Frobenius theorem. A
mathematical description of the cell-cycle control is shown for
one-compartment and two-compartment populations, where a compartment refers
to a cell population consisting of cells that exhibit similar kinetic
properties. We have incorporated into our mathematical model the required
growing/aging times in each phase of the cell cycle for the biological
viability. Moreover, we have derived analytical formulae for vital
parameters in cancer research, such as population doubling time, the
average cell-cycle age, and the average removal age from all phases, which
we argue is the average cell-cycle time of the population. An estimate of
the average cell-cycle time is of a particular interest for biologists and
clinicians, and for patient survival prognoses as it is considered that
short cell-cycle times correlate with poor survival prognoses for patients.

Applications of our mathematical model to experimental data have been
shown. First, we have derived algebraic expressions to determine the
population doubling time from single experimental observation as an
alternative to empirically constructed growth curve. This result is
applicable to various types of cancer cell lines. One option to extend
this model would be to derive the cell cycle time from a single
experimental measurement. Second, we have applied our mathematical model
to interpret and derive dynamic-depicting parameters of five melanoma cell
lines exposed to radiotherapy. The mathematical result suggests there are
shortcomings in the experimental methods and provides an insight into the
cancer cell population dynamics during post radiotherapy. Finally, a
mathematical model depicting a theoretical cancer cell population that
comprises two sub-populations with different kinetic properties is
presented to describe the transition of a primary culture to a cell line
cell population.

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) can inhibit proliferation of
multiple reproductive tissue cancer cell lines through direct interaction
with GnRH receptors (GnRHR) on tumour cells. GnRH analogues may therefore
have a role in treating some cancers. The signalling pathways associated
with these inhibitory effects are poorly defined, and characterising them
may help to understand therapeutic sensitivity. To elucidate these
pathways, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches were used to compare the
effects of the GnRH agonist Triptorelin in responsive GnRHR-transfected
HEK293 cells (SCL60) and unresponsive (HEK293) cells both in vitro for up
to 24h and in vivo for up to 7 days. Gene expression profiling
demonstrated that SCL60 gene expression was temporally regulated with
Triptorelin treatment, with expression of some genes increased at one time
point but decreased at another. Early and mid-phase gene expression
changes comprised mainly transcription factors and late changes included
the hormonal signalling component CGA. Pathway analysis implicated mitogen-
activated protein kinase and cell cycle pathways, supporting the detection
of G2/M arrest. Signalling effects within SCL60 xenografts, 4 and 7 days
following Triptorelin treatment, were investigated using a
phosphoproteomic antibody array. Changes included cell cycle and apoptosis
regulators, as well as cell surface receptors and NFkappaB signalling
pathway members. Reverse-phase protein arrays and western blotting also
showed that pAkt was decreased and pNFkappaB-p65 was increased after
Triptorelin treatment in vitro. An NFkappaB inhibitor enhanced the anti-
proliferative effect of Triptorelin in SCL60 cells in vitro, suggesting
that NFkappaB acts as a survival factor in the response to GnRHR
stimulation. A range of GnRHR expression was observed in breast cancer
tumours by immunohistochemistry, and on average GnRHR expression was
significantly higher in the Triple Negative Phenotype (TNP) subgroup and
in grade 3 tumours. A GnRHR-transfected breast cancer cell line, MCF7-h14,
was developed. Despite this expressing a similar level of GnRHR to
responsive SCL60 cells, MCF7-h14 cells were not inhibited by GnRHR
activation, indicating that a high level of GnRHR is insufficient for the
antiproliferative effects of Triptorelin.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the third most common
form of muscular dystrophy in Caucasians. FSHD is caused by contraction of
a 3.3kb repeat array, D4Z4, to below 11 repeat units. Each of these repeat
units contains an ORF encoding the DUX4 gene and at the beginning of the
work described in this thesis expression of transcripts from the most
distal repeat of this D4Z4 array had been reported. However, expression
data from the DUX4 gene was new and most research focussed on contraction
of the array having a position affect on the expression of neighbouring
genes.

There is a similar Dux array located in the mouse genome. This array also
contains an ORF in each repeat and transcripts from this gene have been
detected in a number of different tissues. This array is not present in
the same chromosomal location as the D4Z4 array in humans so is unlikely
to be a true ortholog, however it is the only Dux array in the mouse
genome and may therefore be functionally equivalent.

The work described in this thesis provides evidence for transcription from
multiple repeats of the D4Z4 array in a human embryonal carcinoma cell
line and gives information on the sequence variation within these
transcripts. In addition, this work contributes to an understanding of
expression from the mouse Dux array. Similar to the human array,
expression appears to come from multiple repeat units, and analysis of the
sequences amplified by RT-PCR identifies variants which suggest some of
these transcripts are non-coding.

The aim of this work is to determine whether human DUX4 and mouse Dux
genes have equivalent functions with the long-term goal of producing a
mouse model for FSHD.

In mammalian cell culture, serum deprivation inhibits cell growth and
induces apoptosis. Adapting host cells to serum-free medium is difficult
and time-consuming, therefore anti-apoptosis engineering of mammalian cells
were used to account the problems caused by serum deprivation. The
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is the most effective member
of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, where it inhibits
apoptosis by retarding the downstream caspase activity in the apoptosis
chain cascade. In an attempt to investigate the ability of XIAP to delay
serum-deprived-induced-apoptosis, stable CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the
XIAP proteins were established by introducing the XIAP gene into the host
genome. Transfected cells with high expression of XIAP were selected by
conducting the MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Selected cell line
was cultured and closely examined under several serum-deprived
conditions. During exposure to serum deprived medium, cells expressing
XIAP showed decreased level of apoptosis and a higher number of viable
cells compared to the control cell lines. The viability of control cells
dropped to 40% after 2 days of serum deprivation, while the XIAP
expressing cells still maintained at a viability over 90%, where caspase-3
activity was found to be inhibited. Meanwhile, the study also showed that
CHO-K1-XIAP cells exhibited a slower growth profile, where most of the
cells were found to be located in the G0/G1 phase. The results suggest
that the over-expression of XIAP induces G0/G1 growth arrest, where
proliferation was retracted, leading to a 50% reduction in maximum cell
density. In the following attempt to investigate the productivity of the
established cell line, the CHO-K1-XIAP cell line was then co-transfected
with cycle-3 green fluorescent protein (GFP), as a model protein to access
the productivity of the cells. Cells were cultured under serum-deprived
condition with addition of sodium butyrate (NaBu) treatment in various
concentrations. NaBu is widely used to boost up the commercial production
of recombinant proteins, but was found to be cytotoxic and causes rapid
apoptotic cell death in mammalian cell cultures. Upon subjecting the cells
to serumdeprived and NaBu-induced condition, the control significantly
declines in cell viability and GFP production. The CHO-K1-GFP expressing
XIAP remained robust and continued to express GFP for the initial 2
days, having a 52% increment of high GFP producers. Moreover, the results
indicated that the intracellular levels of GFP were further increased
while cells became progressively growth-arrested, shifting 33% of the low
GFP producers to high GFP producers. Although XIAP over expression could
not effectively inhibit NaBu-induced apoptosis, however, a 35% reduction
of caspase-3 activation was observed in CHO-K1-XIAP-GFP cells at its
termination point. Taken together, host cells solely expressing a single
type of anti-apoptotic protein are found to be inadequate in regard to
extension of culture longevity and enhancement
 of protein production.
Therefore, for a better and more effective apoptosis inhibition, a
combination of caspases inhibitor and mitochondrial dysfunction should
be considered in future studies.

The cod populations of the Canadian Atlantic were once highly productive,
generating enormous annual harvests and attracting fishing fleets from
many nations. However, through the late 1980s improved fishing technology,
unprecedented capture rates, and poor fishery management brought wild
stocks beyond the point of collapse. Dwindling harvests in the early 1990s
resulted in cod fishing moratoriums, and an end to the productivity for
which the fishery was once renowned. Atlantic cod remains a popular food
worldwide and the collapse of cod fisheries has done little to abate
market demands. Consequently, the cod is considered a prime candidate for
aquaculture production, providing the impetus for commercial-scale farming
operations. As aquaculture efforts continue to grow, disease management
challenges have become a prominent concern. Many parasites are prevalent
on cod farms, including intracellular pathogens such as viruses and
microsporidians. Detailed research into diseases affecting farming
operations is imperative if commercial-scale cod aquaculture is to develop.
Piscine cell culture techniques represent a valuable tool for studying the
intracellular pathogens currently impeding cod aquaculture. To date
however, few cell culture models have been made available for the Atlantic
cod. This research details the establishment of a larval cod cell line,
GML-5, investigations of infective processes in microsporidian parasites,
and development of in vitro culture methods for a microsporidian parasite
of the Atlantic cod. GML-5 cells have been cultured for two years and
survived more than 26 passages in L-15 media supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and incubated at 18 Celsius. The cells have tested positive
for a marker of stem cell-like characteristics, had their origin
identified as Gadus morhua by DNA barcoding, and been cryopreserved for
long-term storage. The cells have been successfully used to support the
growth of two microsporidian parasites. Infection-mediating effects of
Mg2+ and EDTA have been confirmed in a previously-untested microsporidian
species and novel pH treatments were successfully used to stimulate
infection and development of Loma morhua in GML-5 cells. The results of
this research represent the foundations of an in vitro infection model for
Loma morhua, and demonstrate shared responses to specific chemical
conditions by microsporidian parasites with highly dissimilar host species.

Fibrosarcoma is a deadly disease in cats and is most often located at
classical vaccine injections sites. More rare forms of spontaneous
non-vaccination site (NSV) fibrosarcomas have been described and have been
found associated to genetic alterations.

Purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of adenoviral gene
therapy in NVS fibrosarcoma. The NVS fibrosarcoma cell line (Cocca-6A) was
isolated from a spontaneous fibrosarcoma that occurred in a domestic
calico cat. Cocca-6A fibrosarcoma cells were morphologically and
cytogenetically characterized. The feline cells were karyotyped and their
chromosome number was counted using a Giemsa staining. Giemsa block
staining of metaphase spreads of the Cocca-6A cells demonstrated deletion
of one of the E1 chromosomes, where feline p53 maps. Adenoviral gene
therapy demonstrated a remarkable effect on the viability and growth of
the Cocca-6A cells following transduction with adenoviruses carrying
RB/p105, Ras-DN, Mda-7/IL-24 or their combination. Adenoviral gene
transfer was verified by western blot analysis. Flow cytometry assay and
annexin-V were used to study cell-cycle changes and cell death of
transduced cells.

Therapy for feline fibrosarcomas is often insufficient for long lasting
tumor eradication. The use of Ad.Ras-DN, Ad.Rb/p105 and Ad.Mda7/IL-24 has
been identified as a gene therapy for a possible future adjuvant treatment
in spontaneous feline fibrosarcoma. More gene therapy studies should be
conducted in order to understand if these viral vectors could be
applicable regardless the origin (spontaneous vs. vaccine induced) of
feline fibrosarcomas.

Mast cells are cells with ubiquitous tissue distribution, derived from
CD34 + multipotent hematopoietic cells. These cells play a fundamental
role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune response and in
IgE-dependent allergic reactions or in various inflammatory reactions.
Mastocytosis is defined as a myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder,
caused by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in one or more organ
systems. Mastocytosis presents in cutaneous and systemic forms. In
patients with systemic mastocytosis, the most frequent point mutation is
KIT D816V, whereas in pediatric patients, where the disease is usually
restricted to the skin, different KIT defects have been detected, mostly
in the extracellular portion of KIT. In a primary culture of mast cells
made from precursors of one cord blood, we have successfully isolated a
new human mast cell line called ROSA KIT WT with a phenotype and
reactivity comparable to those of normal mast cells. This cell line is
dependent on SCF for growth and expresses the KIT receptor wild. It is
easy to grow in large quantities, to freeze and to activate by IgE-anti
IgE couple or a couple of allergen and corresponding specific IgE. This
cell line can be used to study pathophysiologic mechanisms of allergy and
to develop and use high-throughput screening tests of molecules in search
of anti-allergic properties.In addition, we transfected these cells by
lentiviral vectors providing constructs encoding the mutated KIT D816V or
the mutated KIT Delta 417-419 insY, two KIT abnormalities encountered in
the course of mastocytosis. This allowed us to establish two new cell
lines independent of SCF for proliferation, ROSA KIT D816V and ROSA KIT
Delta417-419 insY, which are particularly easy to grow in large
quantities, and whose phenotype is similar to that of abnormal mast cells
during mastocytosis. These two cell lines can be used for pathophysiologic
studies on mastocytosis and for high throughput screening of molecules in
search of antiproliferative effects specifically directed against the
mutated KIT or against one or other of the intracellular molecules
involved in signal transduction induced by mutant KIT.

In recent years many emerging viruses threatening human health were
discovered and found to have their major host reservoir in bats. Rabies,
Ebola, Henipah and Coronaviruses are the most prominent under these
zoonotic pathogens, where especially the emergence of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2002 and the recent appearance
of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus had gained global
awareness. Great effort has been invested to uncover the course of events
of their introduction to the human population. Coronaviruses may be
exemplary for many zoonotic RNA viruses, so that the study of their
genesis expected to provide insights into basic questions about viral
zoonosis. For coronaviruses the recognition of a specific receptor by the
viral glycoprotein appears to be a major constrain of interspecies
transmission. Therefore, it is important to address the question whether a
large shift in receptor specificity was necessary for their transmission
to humans. The closest related relative to SARS coronavirus was identified
in bats of the genus Rhinolophus in South-East of China, but until today
no coronavirus was isolated from bats. What is known is that these viruses
are not able to utilise the same receptor as the human SARS coronavirus,
the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The aim of our studies
was to identify the receptor of these bat SARS-like coronaviruses, which
would help to estimate the likelihood of their transmission to humans. We
therefore used three different glycoproteins of bat SARS-like
coronaviruses isolated from Rhinolophus bats in China, Bulgaria and Spain
and tried to identify their cellular receptors analysing cell lines of 14
different bat species, in binding as well as infection assays.
Unfortunately neither binding nor infection could be observed for the
spike proteins tested. We also tested known coronavirus receptors like
human ACE2, aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) and
successfully cloned Rhinolophus ACE2 and DPP4. None of these proteins
facilitated binding or infection in transient expression. This indicates
that bat SARS-like coronaviruses utilise a novel coronavirus receptor. In
contrast, we could show that SARS coronavirus can utilise ACE2 of two
Rhinolophus species living in Europe, indicating that a proposed switch in
receptor specificity may not be obligatory for the precursor of SARS-CoV
to cross the species barrier. It may further suggests that bats are
reservoir to at least two different lineages of coronaviruses, which
differ in their receptor usage.

Background: Exportin 1 (XPO1, also known as CRM1), is a protein responsible
for the export of over 200 target proteins out of the nucleus. XPO1 is
upregulated in several human cancers and its expression is also linked to
the development of chemotherapy resistance. Recent studies using both
human and murine cancer cell lines have demonstrated that XPO1 is a
relevant target for therapeutic intervention. The present study sought to
characterize the biologic activity of an orally bioavailable selective
inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), KPT-335, against canine melanoma cell
lines as a prelude to future clinical trials in dogs with melanoma.
Results: We evaluated the effects of KPT-335 on 4 canine malignant
melanoma cell lines and found that KPT-335 inhibited proliferation and
induced apoptosis of treated cells. Additionally, KPT-335 downregulated
XPO1 protein while inducing a concomitant increase in XPO1 messenger RNA.
Lastly, KPT-335 treatment of cell lines induced the expression of the
tumor suppressors p53 and p21, with enhanced nuclear localization.

Conclusion: KPT-335 demonstrates biologic activity against canine melanoma
cell lines at physiologically relevant doses, suggesting that KPT-335 may
represent a viable treatment option for dogs with malignant melanoma.

This thesis describes the establishment, characterization and potential
toxicological applications of YPF5, a yellow perch cell line. YPF5 is a
fibroblastic cell line derived from the caudal fin of yellow perch. This
cell line has been maintained for over 2 years. Cultures have been
passaged over 60 times, and successfully cryopreserved and thawed. YPF5 is
grown at room temperature in Leibovitz-15 (L-15) media, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 3% penicillin-streptomycin. The origin of YPF5
has been confirmed as Perca flavescens through 'DNA Barcoding' and
reaffirmed through Karyotyping (2n = 48) as per literature reported
karyology for percidae including the yellow perch. YPF5 tested positive
for alkaline phosphatase and negative for beta-galactosidase, markers of
stem cell-like characteristics and senescence, respectively, providing
evidence for a continuous cell line. Immunofluorescence staining with
mesodermal cell markers (vimentin and collagen type 1) also confirmed the
fibroblastic origin of the cells. In agreement with related literature,
the morphological response of YPF5 exposed to cortisol made cells more
epithelial-like, and exposure to ascorbic acid induced extracellular
collagen secretion. YPF5 responded to different contaminants (naphthenic
acid, copper sulphate, ammonium chloride and OSPW samples) in a dose
dependent manner. Evaluation of possible remediation methods using
bentonite and UV radiation to ameliorate toxicity of oil sands chemicals
showed promise in vitro with YPF5 cells and could be investigated further.

Metastasis and drug resistance present as major problems to patients
during cancer chemotherapy. The research outlined in this thesis aims to
further our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in these
processes and the relationship between drug resistance and cancer invasion
and/or metastasis. One explanation for the link between resistance and
metastasis is that resistance facilitates tumour progression and invasion
into both surrounding and distal tissues. Investigations were conducted on
a clonal sub-population of poorly differentiated human lung squamous
carcinoma cells (DLKP). These were pulsed with mitoxantrone and the
resulting cell populations extensively characterised. Two sub-lines
emerged: SQ-Mitox-BCRP and SQ-Mitox-MDR cell lines. These two cell lines
typically exhibited resistance to the selecting agent (ranging approx. 210
to 320-fold). This occurred as an early event during the pulsing process.
The two sublines differed in their morphology and pattern of gene
expression. In addition, BCRP was significantly increased in one
population (SQ-Mitox-BCRP) while P-gp was significantly increased in the
other population (SQ-Mitox-MDR). A crucial step in human lung cancer
progression appears to be the acquisition of invasiveness. The population
of cells arising from the 4th drug pulse remained noninvasive but had
acquired a high level of drug resistance. However, after two additional
drug pulses, all cell lines acquired invasiveness. The invasive, drug
resistant BCRP and MDR cell line variants were characterised in depth and
microarray analysis was used to find functionally significant changes in
the transition from the preinvasive to the invasive phenotype. Functional
and cellular signaling analyses were performed on the cell lines using
pharmacological inhibitors, function-blocking antibodies, and gene
silencing by RNA interference. The DLKP cell line appears to contain at
least three morphologically distinct sub-populations of cells with
different levels of invasiveness. Microarray analysis generated gene lists
that were specific to an invasive phenotype, identifying possible genetic
markers for invasion. Proteins (including the cell adhesion molecules,
N-cadherin and ALCAM and the axon guidance molecule SLIT2) were also
identified as possible and alternative markers capable of distinguishing
between the different cell line clones.

Recombinant glycoprotein drugs require proper glycosylation for optimal
therapeutic efficacy. Glycoprotein therapeutics are quickly removed from
circulation and have reduced efficacy if they are poorly sialylated.
Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) was found highly toxic to wild-type
CHO-K1 cells and all the mutants that survived RCA-I treatment contained a
dysfunctional N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I) gene. These
mutants are called CHO-gmt4 cells. CHO-gmt4 cells were observed to
transiently and stably express erythropoietin (EPO) that was better
sialylated than the wild-type CHO-K1 cells when functional GnT I was
restored. CHO-gmt4D cells, derived from CHO-gmt4 by knocking out
dihydrofolate reductase, were stably transfected with both EPO and GnT I
and after gene amplification, a panel of clones that produced EPO with
superior sialylation was generated. One of these clones, named CHO-gmt4D-
EPO-GnT I was cultured in an industrial perfusion-culture based bioreactor
and the resulting superior sialylation of EPO was maintained as shown
through isoelectric focusing, HPAEC-PAD, sialic acid quantification and
MALDI-TOF analyses. These results demonstrate that the CHO-gmt4 cell line
can be applied in the production of better sialylated recombinant EPO and
possibly other recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins.

Thiopurines are cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs widely prescribed,
mainly in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They constitute one of the
best success story of pharmacogenetic implementation into clinical
practice based on the screening of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)
deficiency, a key enzyme in thiopurine metabolism. Optimization of
thiopurine response is challenging because of its large interindividual
variability such as inefficacy and toxicities. This thesis has explored,
on one hand, the relationships between TPMT activity and metabolite
concentrations, and on the other hand, factors associated with thiopurine
inefficacy. Using a primary care pharmacogenetic database, we first
analyzed TPMT distribution and genotype-phenotype correlation, in relation
with thiopurine metabolites in a large population. Using a PheWAS study
based on a clinical data warehouse we then reported that a very high TPMT
activity ('ultra-rapid' phenotype) was associated with parameters of
active IBD and poor response to thiopurines. Furthermore, a retrospective
study in pediatric IBD identified factors predicting the occurrence of
lymphopenia during thiopurine therapy. Finally, using a lymphoblastoid
cell line (LCL) in vitro model, we established a transcriptomic signature,
including 32 genes predicting thiopurine cellular resistance. A
bioinformatic functional analysis identified metabolic pathways in
relation with p53 and cell cycle, as well as molecular mechanisms
associated with thiopurine resistance. To conclude, this research work,
focusing on the variability of thiopurine response and mainly therapeutic
resistance, provides new hypotheses to individualize and optimize
therapeutic response to thiopurines.

Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, as
well as augment chemotherapeutics and irradiation in multiple cancer types.
However, it is unknown if resveratrol is beneficial for treating drug-
resistant cancer cells. To study the effects of resveratrol in triple
negative breast cancer cells that are resistant to the common cancer drug,
paclitaxel, a novel paclitaxel-resistant cell line was generated from the
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The resulting cell line, MDA-MB-231/PacR,
exhibited a 12-fold increased resistance to paclitaxel but
remained sensitive to resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol treatment reduced
cell proliferation and colony formation and increased senescence and
apoptosis in both the parental MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/PacR cell lines.
Importantly, resveratrol treatment augments the effects of paclitaxel in
both cell lines. The expression of the drug efflux transporter gene, MDR1,
and the main metabolizing enzyme of paclitaxel gene, CYP2C8, was increased
in the resistant cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the
protein products of these genes, P-glycoprotein and CYP2C8, decreased
paclitaxel resistance in the resistant but not in the parental cells,
which suggests that the increase of these proteins are important
contributors to the resistance of these cells. In conclusion, these
studies imply that resveratrol, both alone and in combination with
paclitaxel, may be useful in the treatment of paclitaxel-sensitive and
paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancers.

This thesis has developed from the walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill),
cell lines (WE) and used them to study viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus
(VHSV IVb), which is the causative agent for viral hemorrhagic septicaemia
(VHS), and to contribute to the comparative cellular biology and
physiology of fish. The outcomes have been organized into six chapters
whose major discoveries are abstracted below.

A cell line, WE-cfin11f, with a fibroblast-like morphology was developed
from a caudal fin and used to study the intersection of thermobiology of
walleye with the thermal requirements for replication of VHSV IVb. WE-cfin11f
proliferated from 10 C to 32 C and endured as a monolayer for at
least a week at 1 C to 34 C. WE-cfin11f adopted an epithelial-shape and
did not proliferate at 4 C. Adding VHSV IVb to cultures at 4 C and 14 C
but not 26 C led to cytopathic effects (CPE) and virus production. At 4 C,
virus production developed more slowly, but western blotting showed more N
protein accumulation. Infecting monolayer cultures at 4 C for 7 days and
then shifting them to 26 C resulted in the monolayers being broken in
small areas by CPE, but with time at 26 C the monolayers were restored.
These results suggest that at 26 C the VHSV IVb life cycle stages
responsible for CPE can be completed but the production of virus and the
initiation of infections cannot be accomplished.

A cell line, WE-cfin11e, with an epithelial-like morphology was developed
from a caudal fin, characterized as distinct from the fibroblast-like cell
line, WE-cfin11f, and compared with WE-cfin11f for susceptibility to VHSV
IVb. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscope were used to localize the
intermediate filament protein, vimentin, the tight junction protein, zona
occludin (ZO-1), the extracellular matrix protein, collagen I, and the
viral protein, G. Although both cell lines contained vimentin, only
WE-cfin11e stained for ZO-1 and only WE-cfin11f stained for collagen I.
Ascorbic acid increased the accumulation of collagen I and caused the
appearance of collagen fibers only in WE-cfin11f cultures. At 14 C, both
cell lines produced VHSV IVb but the infection developed more rapidly in
WE-cfin11f. At 4 C both cell lines became infected with VHSV IVb as judged
by the expression of viral proteins, N and G, but only WE-cfin11f produced
virus. The results suggest that low temperature can modulate viral tropism.

A cell line, WE-spleen6, has been developed from the stromal layer of
primary spleen cell cultures. On conventional plastic, WE-spleen 6 cells
had a spindle morphology at low cell density but grew to become epithelial-
like at confluency. On the commercial extracellular matrix (ECM),
Matrigel, the cells remained spindle shaped and formed lumen-like
structures. WE-spleen 6 cells had intermediate filament protein, vimentin
and the ECM protein, collagen I, but not smooth muscle a-actin (SMA) and
von Willebrand factor (vWF) and lacked alkaline phosphatase and phagocytic
activities. WE-spleen6 was more susceptible to infection with VHSV IVb
than a fibroblast cell line from the walleye caudal fin, WE-cfin11f. Viral
transcripts and proteins appeared earlier in WE-spleen6 cultures as did
cytopathic effect (CPE) and significant virus production. The synthetic
double stranded RNA (dsRNA), polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (pIC),
induced the antiviral protein Mx in both cell lines. Treating WE-spleen6
cultures with pIC prior to infection with VHSV IVb inhibited the early
accumulation of viral transcripts and proteins and delayed the appearance
of CPE and significant viral production. Of particular note, pIC caused
the disappearance of viral P protein 2 days post infection. WE-spleen6
should be useful for investigating the impact of VHSV IVb on hematopoietic
organs and the actions of pIC on the rhabdovirus life cycle.

A cell line, WEBA, has been developed from the bulbus arteriosus (BA).
WEBA produced collagen I, and when held at confluency for days or weeks,
spontaneously formed capillary-like tubes. WEBA cells bound fluorescently-
labeled Ulex europaeus lectin agglutinin I (UEA-1), took up acetylated low
density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL), stained for von Willebrand factor (vWF), and
produced nitric oxide (NO). The cytoskeleton consisted at least of alpha-
and beta-tubulin, vimentin, and actin, with the actin organized into
circumferential bundles. Immunofluorescent staining revealed at least two
tight junction proteins, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin 3. Together
these results suggest that WEBA is an endothelial cell line. Relatively
high doses of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) induced cytochrome
P4501A (CYP1A) protein and 7-ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD) activity
in WEBA. As one of the first fish endothelial and BA cell lines, WEBA
should be useful in many disciplines in which the teleost cardiovascular
system is a focus.

Cell lines and primary cultures from several teleost tissues and species
were stained for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA beta-Gal),
revealing four general outcomes. (1) For long-standing fish cell lines
that can be considered immortal, little or no SA beta-Gal staining was
observed, regardless of the culture conditions. (2) For a new walleye cell
line from the bulbous arteriosus (WEBA), most cells stained for SA beta-Gal
even after 40 passages. This suggested that high SA beta-Gal activity
was a unique property of WEBA, perhaps reflecting their endothelial
character, rather than cellular senescence. (3) For cell lines developed
from the walleye caudal fin and from somatic cells in rainbow trout
coelomic fluid, no SA beta-Gal staining was observed in the earliest
cultures to over 70 passages later. This suggested that cells from these
anatomical sites do not undergo senescence in vitro. (4) By contrast, for
cell lines developed from the walleye brain and from somatic cells in
rainbow trout milt, most cells in the early stage cultures stained for SA
beta-Gal, but as these were developed into cell lines, SA beta-Gal
negative cells became dominant. This suggested that if cellular senescence
occurred in vitro, this happened early in these cultures and subsequently
a few SA beta-Gal negative cells went onto to form the cell line. Overall
the presence of SA beta-Gal positive cells in cultures could be
interpreted in several ways, whereas their absence predicted that in these
cultures cells would proliferate indefinitely.

Twenty three cell lines from seven fish species were examined
immunocytochemically with the monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6-11B-1, for
acetylated a-tubulin, revealing universal staining of some structures,
such as midbodies, but more restricted staining for others, such as
primary cilia. The midbody and mitotic spindle stained strongly in all the
cell lines. As well as being from two salmonid species, Chinook salmon
(Onchorhynchus tshawytscha) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss), the cell lines
were from Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), haddock (Melanogrammus
aeglefinus), walleye (Sander vitreus), fathead minnow (Pimephales
promelas), and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Strong cytoplasmic staining of
microtubule networks was observed in only a few cell lines. These were
from walleye brain (astroglial-like), spleen (epithelia-like), skin
(fibroblastic) and liver (fibroblastic). For the same species, cell lines
with an endothelial-like shape from the bulbous arteriosus and epithelial-
like shape from the caudal fin and eye retina had no cytoplasmic staining.
Primary cilia stained intensely in seven of eight walleye cell lines and
in cell lines from fathead minnow (EPC), zebrafish (ZSSJ), and Pacific
herring (PHL). By contrast, few or no primary cilia were observed in
cultures of the other twelve cell lines, one from haddock and eleven from
salmonids, and in cultures of these cell lines a portion of the cells had
weak staining in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. Overall this is the
first demonstration of primary cilia in fish cell lines and of cells from
a particular taxonomic group, in this case the salmonids, being unable to
maintain primary cilia in vitro. In the future, these fish cell lines
could be used to study the formation and function of primary cilia, but as
well, primary cilia could be a useful marker for characterizing new fish
cell lines.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumour which arises
from calcitonin-producing parafollicular C-cells and accounts for 5% to
10% of all thyroid cancers, with an estimated age-adjusted annual
incidence of 0.18 for men and 0.23 for women per 100.000 inhabitants. MTC
occurs as either a sporadic form or in a familial context (25% of cases).
Familial forms are inherited in an autosomal-dominant way, either as part
of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2A (MEN 2A) or 2B (MEN 2B),
or without any associated endocrinopathies as familial MTC (FMTC).
Surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue in the neck by total
thyroidectomy, central and bilateral neck dissection is the only
potentially curative treatment in localized disease. However, at the time
of initial DIagnosis, at least one quarter of patients has distant
metastases. MTC research is a major focus of Institute for Pathophysiology
and Immunology during the last 2.5 decades: 9 MTC-derived cell lines have
been established and characterized. These approved cell lines are
constantly used to study the MTC biology and to test therapeutic agents.
The aim of this work is to give an overview about the MTC tumour marker
and the new therapeutic strategies and drugs for the treatment of MTC.
Furthermore, the aim is to assemble the data provided about MTC cell lines
and to give an overview of their characteristics.

ERBB4 (Her-4) is a member of the ERBB family of class I receptor tyrosine
kinases. ERBB4 is unique within the ERBB family for alternate splicing in
its juxtamembrane and cytoplasmic regions, which produces four
juxtamembrane isoforms and two cytoplasmic isoforms. The cleavable
juxtamembrane isoforms, Jm-a and Jm-d, can undergo proteolytic cleavage
and produce an 80-kDa cytoplasmic fragment referred to as "p80" which has
been demonstrated to enhance cellular survival and malignant behavior in
many solid tumors. ERBB4 was almost exclusively 80 kDa in size and
localized to the nucleus in primary tumors and metastases in studies
characterizing ERBB4 expression in osteosarcoma, indicating that ERBB4 may
be cleaved to enhance malignant behavior in osteosarcoma. ERBB4 protein
was significantly up-regulated from monolayer to sphere cultures in
osteosarcoma, leading to the hypothesis that there would be an
up-regulation of the cleavable isoforms Jm-a and Jm-d from monolayer to
sphere cultures of osteosarcoma.

The first aim of this thesis was to measure if the proportion of cleavable
juxtamembrane isoform expression in osteosarcoma tumor spheres from
monolayer culture. All cell lines on the panel showed a significant
increase in expression, by proportion or up-regulation, of at least one of
the cleavable juxtamembrane isoforms Jm-a or Jm-d in sphere culture. We
hypothesized that there would be a significant reduction of lung
metastases with shRNA specific for Her-4 in osteosarcoma cells in
xenograft mice. Immunohistochemical staining for ERBB4 was performed on
sections of lungs from the experimental mice injected with CCH-OS-O cells
with shRNA against ERBB4 and controls, with adjacent sections stained with
vimentin as a counterstain for total osteosarcoma metastases. There were
significant reductions in formation of ERBB4-negative macrometastases
(>200 microns) in ERBB4 control mice and of ERBB4-negative micrometastases
(6 cells-200 microns) in ERBB4 control and ERBB4 knockdown mice over two
experiments. There was not a significant difference in the numbers of
oligometastases (1-5 cells) in ERBB4 knockdown and control mice. Taken
together, the immunohistochemistry suggests that ERBB4 expression may be
important to metastatic progression, or formation of detectable foci, in
osteosarcoma.

Baculoviruses have a significant potential as biological pesticides.
Spodoptera littoralis multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpliMNPV) could
thus be applied to protect plants against the African Cotton Leafworm. For
the in vitro production of SpliMNPV a cellular system has to be
established. For this purpose three new continuous cell lines were
established from embryonic tissues of S. littoralis. These three cell
lines were designated as Spli-C, Spli-S and Spli-B. They consist mostly of
spherical cells in addition to spindle and giant cells. The population
doubling time for Spli-C, Spli-S and Spli-B were 30.5, 31 and 44.5 h,
respectively, at passage 19, while at passage 120 it was 26, 27 and 32 h,
respectively. The DNA fingerprinting techniques RAPD and DAF confirmed
that the cell lines originated from S. littoralis tissues. Lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme analysis showed distinguishable differences
between the three new cell lines and the other insect cell lines used in
our laboratory. Susceptibility tests of the three cell lines showed that
all the cell lines were non-permissive to Autographa californica
multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), with the cells dying a few
hours post-infection and forming apoptosis-like bodies. Nuclear DNA
fragmentation was observed in all AcMNPV-infected cell lines by DNA gel
electrophoresis analysis. At same time, the susceptibility of the three
cell lines to SpliMNPV showed that all the cell lines were susceptible,
whereby many viral occlusion bodies (OBs) were observed inside the
infected cells. The SpliMNPV OB productivity of the three cell lines
showed significant differences. The cell line Spli-C had the highest
susceptibility to SpliMNPV compared to the other two cell lines. The
average of OB production was about 1x10^7 OBs/ml in the Spli-C cell line,
while in Spli-S and Spli-B it was 3.3x10^6 and 2x10^6 OBs/ml, respectively.
In addition, the SpliMNPV polyhedrin gene expression and DNA replication
in the three cell lines were also investigated over time using
quantitative PCR (qPCR). The Spli-C cell line that showed higher OB
production than the other two cell lines was immobilized using sodium
cellulose sulfate (NaCS) and poly-diallyldimethylammonium chloride
(PDADMAC) capsules to protect cells from shear stress caused by agitation
and gas sparging during supply of sufficient oxygen. Cell culture in
capsules leads to high cell densities resulting in increased viral OB
production per volume. The Spli-C cell densities were increased from
4-5x10^6 cells/ml in suspension culture to 1.3x10^7 cells/ml in capsules.
Summarizing, our results suggest that large-scale production of SpliMNPV
as a biopesticide is possible with the new S. littoralis cell lines Spli-C,
Spli-S and Spli-B.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include a wide variety of
structurally diverse compounds that affect normal signaling pathways in
most all animal species by multiple mechanisms. Given the global
distribution of EDCs in environmental, biological and food samples and
commercial products, detection, relative quantitation, and assessment of
their biological/toxicological effects is of paramount importance. While
instrumental methods allow detection and quantitation of specific (known)
EDCs in sample extracts, these methods do not allow identification and
characterization of new EDCs. Accordingly, mechanism-based bioanalytical
methods have been developed to assist in the identification and
characterization of matrices and extracts containing EDCs. The so-called
chemically-activated luciferase expression (CALUX) bioassays and related
CALUX-type bioassays represent a collection of nuclear receptor-based
recombinant cell bioassays for detection of EDCs, including estrogenic-,
androgenic-and dioxin-like chemicals. Although CALUX assays are much
cheaper and quicker than instrumental analysis and whole animal assays,
there is a critical need to make these assays as
biologically/toxicologically relevant and consistent with our current
understanding of endocrine disruption in order to provide optimal data for
selection of chemicals (or mixtures) which warrant in vivo assessment.
This includes improved assay characteristics (i.e., minimal detection
limits (MDLs)) and response to EDCs, inclusion of more receptors (i.e.
multiple subtypes of a given nuclear receptor) and consideration of
receptor cross-talk and related mechanisms. In this dissertation, I
describe two significantly improved CALUX bioassay systems for EDCs. The
first is a set of species-specific Ah receptor (AhR)-responsive CALUX cell
lines that exhibit dramatically increased sensitivity (10-100-fold lower
MDL (to sub pM concentrations)) and responsiveness to 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin) and related dioxin-like
compounds (DLCs), compared to current dioxin-responsive CALUX cell lines.
I demonstrate the utility of these novel AhR-responsive CALUX bioassays in
analysis of sediment extracts. The second CALUX cell line (estrogen
receptor (ER)-CALUX) is a modification of our existing estrogen-responsive
human cell line (BG1Luc4E2). Although this cell line has received official
regulatory approval from the USEPA and OECD (to the point of being
included in the USEPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program) and is
currently being utilized by the Tox21 program for chemical screening
purposes, this cell line only expresses one of the two known human ER
subtypes (ERalpha). Since both ER subtypes (ERalpha and ERbeta) can differ
in their ligand-specificity, cross-talk with other signaling and
transcription factors and gene induction profiles, optimal cell bioassay
assays should be able to detect the full spectrum of ER-active chemicals
(i.e., activators/repressors of ERalpha and/or ERbeta). Accordingly, we
stably transfected the ERalpha-containing BG1LucE2 CALUX cell line with a
human ERbeta expression vector and screening of the resulting BG1LucERbeta
clones with the ERbeta-selective ligands genistein and Br-ERbeta-041
allowed identification and isolation of a clonal cell line
(BG1LucERbetac9) expressing ERbeta and highly responsive to ERbeta-
selective ligands. Comparison of the response of BG1Luc4E2 and
BG1LucERbetac9 cell lines to a chemical library of 176 compounds revealed
that the ERalpha/ERbeta-containing BG1LucERbetac9 cell line can identify a
greater number of potential estrogenic chemicals than the ERalpha-
containing BG1Luc4E2 cell line. Since cross-talk between the AhR and ER
has been identified as a potential mechanism for endocrine disruption in
animals exposed to DLCs (which act to repress ER gene signaling), in the
final chapter I explored cross-talk between AhR and ER in a human breast
carcinoma cell line (SKBR3). I specifically focused on the effect of
ERalpha/ERbeta on AhR gene signaling in transiently transfected cells. In
SKBR3 cells (which lack functional ER), we observed an ERalpha subtype-
specific enhancement of AhR-dependent reporter gene expression (from the
transfected AhR-responsive plasmid pGudLuc6.1) in the absence of added E2
and a repression of the ER-dependent enhancement of AhR signaling by
stimulating transfected ERalpha with E2, PPT, or fulvestrant (no
repression was observed with ERbeta). The repressive effect of E2 could be
abolished by co-incubation of E2-activated ERalpha-transfected SKBR3 cells
with the ER antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen, demonstrating the requirement
for functionally active ERalpha. Our ER-dependent repressive results in
SKBR3 cells indicate that AhR has selective interactions with ERa versus
ERbeta. The results presented in this dissertation demonstrate that the
CALUX reporter vectors and stable cell lines not only have application for
highly sensitive high throughput screening for EDCs systems, but for
in-depth mechanistic studies examining crosstalk between receptor signaling
pathways which can play a critical role in endocrine disruption.

Human population history has been described by analysing different genetic
markers. Much attention has focused on haploid markers (such as mtDNA and
Y chromosome), but this study addresses the X chromosome (haploid in
males, and with a female bias in its history) in order to describe genetic
diversity and to infer human population history in Western Europe.
HapMap Phase I/II data reveal haplotype blocks on the X chromosome, called
PHAXs (Phylogeographically informative Haplotypes on Autosomes and X
chromosome), in which recombination is historically absent and mutations
are likely to be the only source of genetic variation. Three such regions
were chosen to meet several criteria such that mutations in these loci are
putatively neutral. These loci have been deep sequenced in 240 samples
from Europe, the Middle East and Africa using the Ion Torrent PGM next-
generation sequencing (NGS) platform. Short-tandem repeats (STRs) were
also typed in order to provide: i) greater discrimination, and ii) a test
of different software tools able to call STRs from NGS data. This dataset
was validated against a standard STR typing procedure using capillary
electrophoresis. PHAXs were confirmed to be largely non-recombining across
European samples. All three loci show a remarkably homogeneous pattern
across Europe and high Fst values with the African sample. Overall, 30% of
singleton variants are European-specific, and this excess of rare alleles
is consistent with signals of expansion in Europe, with the Middle East
and Africa showing a weaker pattern. Additional samples from the Complete
Genomics dataset confirmed these patterns showing European-and Middle
Eastern-specific haplotypes. Bayesian skyline plots suggest a European-
specific expansion around 20 KYA with a more recent peak around 10 KYA.
This study demonstrates the value of the use of haplotype blocks, and the
accurate ascertainment of rare variants to infer human demographic history.

The study of adipose tissue takes advantage of in vitro experimental
models constituted by cultures of primary preadipocytes or adipose cell
lines. The first ones represent with high fidelity the metabolism of the
cell adipose lineage but have a limited life span and decreasing capacity
when subcultivated. The second ones show an ilimited proliferative
capacity but they do not necessarily have all the functional attributes of
the adipose cell lineage. The most commonly used adipogenic cell lines
have a murine origin and present genetic and metabolic differences
withrespect to the human cells. Although human adipogenic cell lines have
been described, its use is limited, and currently there is not an vitro
model system widely used for the study of human adipogenesis. Here we
characterize a clonal cell strain of human subcutaneous preadipocytes,
PASH-4, to explore its utility as an in vitro model system for human
adipogenesis. The PASH-4 cells proliferated for 30 serial subcultures,
showing population doubling times of 47 h and 95 h in the 17th and 26th
subculture, and a clonogenic capacity of 7% and 2% in the 15th and 25th
subculture, respectively. The PASH-4 cells maintained their adipogenic
capacity until the 26th subculture, expressing the early adipose molecular
markers C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta even as preadipocytes. The PASH-4 cells
were diploid (46XY) at least until 20th subculture. All these
characteristics make the PASH-4 strain a useful model for in vitro human
adipogenesis studies and a population suitable of normal human
preadipocytes to generate an established cell line of human preadipocytes.

Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogeneous group of
inherited motor neuron diseases characterized by progressive spasticity
and weakness of the lower limbs. Mutations in the Spastic Paraplegia
Gene 11 (SPG11), encoding spatacsin, cause the most frequent form of
autosomal recessive HSP. SPG11 patients are clinically distinguishable
from most other HSPs, by severe cortical atrophy and presence of a thin
corpus callosum (TCC), associated with cognitive deficits.

Partly due to lack of a relevant disease model, the distinct cellular and
molecular mechanisms modulating these symptoms have not been deciphered
so far. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three
SPG11 patients, having heterozygous nonsense and/or splice site
mutations, and two age matched controls. We differentiated these iPSCs
into forebrain neuronal cells and investigated the neuronal pathology
associated with the disease. The overall aim of our study was to (i)
investigate the spatio-temporal localization and expression analysis of
spatacsin in different cell types available (ii) to recapitulate early
neurodevelopmental deficits at the cortical neural progenitor cells
(NPCs) stage, and (iii) to delineate the neurodegenerative phenotype and
slowly progressive cortical degeneration in terminally differentiated
neurons.

We show here, preferential expression of spatacsin in human neurons,
particularly in cortical projection neurons. Importantly, spatacsin is
temporally expressed all throughout neuronal differentiation and
maturation. Our NPC model evidenced, widespread transcriptional
alterations in neurodevelopmental pathways, associated with proliferation
deficit and impaired cortical neurogenesis. Interestingly, these early
developmental phenotypes were rescued by GSK3 modulation. Examination of
terminally differentiated neurons from SPG11 patients revealed axonal
degeneration, impaired vesicular transport and reduced neuritic
complexity.

In conclusion, our human iPSC model reveals a novel temporal scenario for
SPG11: early onset proliferation and neurogenesis anomalies during
cortical development (in first two decades), mimicking a TCC and cortical
atrophy. Progressive axonal degeneration, in the ensuing decades, results
in impaired axonal transport, with the clinical correlates of spastic
paraparesis and peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, this in-vitro model
offers an ideal platform to screen novel therapeutic compounds for an
intervention during early disease stages, thereby paving the road to
discover new treatment strategies for SPG11 related HSPs.

Background: GDF-15 is a divergent member of the TGF-superfamily, which was
first described as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), revealing an
immune modulatory function. GDF-15 is a soluble protein which is, under
physiological conditions, highly expressed in the placenta and found in
elevated levels in blood sera of pregnant women. Apart from the placenta,
GDF-15 is expressed in healthy tissue, albeit to a lower extent and
overexpressed in many solid tumors. A variety of different functions are
attributed to GDF-15 in healthy as well as diseased humans. On the one
hand, GDF-15 is required for successful pregnancy and low GDF-15 serum
levels during pregnancy correlate with fetal abortion. On the other hand,
overexpression of GDF-15, which can be observed in several malignancies is
correlated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, tumor derived GDF-15 leads
to cancer associated anorexia-cachexia syndrome in mice. The aim of my PhD
thesis was to further investigate the role of GDF-15 as an immune
modulatory factor in cancer, in particular, by inhibiting the target
molecule in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the main focus was placed on the
generation and characterization of monoclonal GDF-15 specific blocking
antibodies, which were tested in vitro and in vivo, which represents a
substantial part of my work.

Results: Here, GDF-15 was shown to be highly expressed in human
gynecological cancer and brain tumors. We could then demonstrate that GDF-15
modulates effector immune cells in vitro. GDF-15 mediated a slight
downregulation of the activating NKG2D receptor on NK and CD8+ T cells,
which is crucial for proper anti-tumoral immune responses. Furthermore, we
could demonstrate that GDF-15 reduces the adhesion of CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells on endothelial cells in vitro. A negatively affected trans-
endothelial migration of leukocytes into inflamed tissue could explain the
low T cell infiltration in GDF-15 expressing tumors, which were observed
in vivo, where mice bearing (shRNA mediated) GDF-15 deficient glioma cells
revealed enhanced immune cell infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment,
compared with the GDF-15 expressing control group. Those animals further
exhibited a decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival. GDF-15 is a
soluble protein, secreted by more than 50% of solid tumors and associated
with grade of malignancy. Therefore a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to
GDF-15 was assumed to be an auspicious therapeutically anti-cancer tool.
Search an antibody was thus generated in GDF-15 knock out mice against
human GFD-15. Amongst many clones, the GDF-15 antibody clone B1-23 was
found to be applicable in Western blot as well as in ELISA techniques,
detecting a three-dimensional epitope of the mature GDF-15 dimer with high
affinity and specificity. To enable the humanization for a later
administration in humans, the variable regions of antibody B1-23 were
identified by a special PCR method using degenerate primers and cloned
into a sequencing vector. The sequence obtained thereby enabled the
generation of chimeric and humanized B1-23 variants. After further
comprehensive characterization, the original mouse antibody B1-23 as well
as the chimeric antibody (ChimB1-23) and the humanized B1-23 antibody
(H1L5) were applied in a melanoma xenograft study in vivo. None of the
antibodies could significantly inhibit tumor growth. However of utmost
importance, body weight loss mediated by tumor derived GDF-15 could be
significantly prevented upon administration of all three GDF-15 specific
antibodies, which confirmed the antagonizing functionality of the
immunoglobulin.

Conclusions: GDF-15 is a promising cancer target, involved in tumor
progression and cancer related cachexia. A monoclonal GDF-15 antibody was
generated, which served on one hand as a tool for molecular biological
applications (Western Blot, ELISA, etc.) and on the other hand was applied
as an antagonizing antibody in vitro and in vivo. Even though tumor growth
inhibition by GDF-15 depletion in T cell deficient athymic mice failed
using B1-23, the same antibody and derivatives thereof (chimeric and
humanized) impressively prevented tumor associated cachexia in UACC-257
melanoma bearing nude mice. The missing anti-tumor effect in our own
melanoma model in nude mice can only partially be explained by the missing
secondary immunity, in particular cytotoxic T cells, in the athymic
animals, since in a similar melanoma model, performed by an external
company, a tumor reduction in immunocompromised animals was observed when
B1-23 was administered. These findings support the idea that T cells are
substantial for an effective tumor immunity and are in line with the
results of the syngeneic, T cell comprising, mouse glioma model, where
silencing of tumor expressed GDF-15 led to an enhanced intratumoral T cell
infiltration and a prolonged survival. Taken together our data allow for
the conclusion that tumor associated cachexia can be combatted with the
GDF-15 antibody B1-23. Further, B1-23 might elicit direct anti-tumor
effects in immune competent models, which contain T cells, rather than in
an athymic, T cell deficient nude mouse model.

The human eccrine sweat gland is present on most body sites and is crucial
for thermoregulation. Yet, little is known on the mechanisms that govern
its function and its morphogenesis. The main reason for the lack in
research with regards to the human eccrine gland is the difficulty in
isolation and maintenance of the glands and cells in vitro. Only one other
cell line derived from the human eccrine gland has ever been reported, the
NCLSG3 cell line. NCL-SG3 cells do not however, function like native
eccrine secretory coil cells, and thus a better cell model was required.
In this project, a human eccrine secretory coil cell line, the EC23 cell
line, was developed, along with 8 clones derived from said cell line. EC23
cells and their clones express a panel of markers characteristic of the
human eccrine sweat gland secretory coil cells. Furthermore, calcium
fluxes can be elicited by cholinergic stimulation of the cells suggesting
retention of the native secretory cell phenotype unlike NCL-SG3 cells. The
EC23 cell line is also responsive to adrenergic stimuli to a higher degree
than NCL-SG3 cells, especially clone 2, however all the cell lines
responded significantly less than primary eccrine secretory coil cells
upon isoproterenol stimulation. It was also found that the mesenchyme has
a crucial effect in determining the formation of eccrine like down-growths
in Matrigel organotypic models seeded with EC23 cells, where organotypics
made with adult fibroblasts failed to form down-growths in comparison to
neonatal fibroblasts. Furthermore, the co-culture of EC23 cell with
keratinocytes enhanced the amount of downgrowth. EC23 cells have the
capacity to form branching structures that resemble native eccrine glands
in GFR Matrigel supplemented with EGF and EDA, and to a lesser extent BMP4.
In conclusion it was demonstrated that the EC23 cells can be used as a
model to study the human eccrine gland, in particular the secretory coil.

Pluripotent stem cells (PSC) include embryonic stem cells (ES) and induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPS). They are defined by two fundamental
properties: self-renewal and the capacity to differentiate into all cell
types. ES cells are derived from the inner cell mass of embryos. They
arouse the interest of the scientific community in particular for their
ability to generate all tissues. They provide major therapeutic and
pharmacological applications, including regenerative medicine, in vitro
modelling of human diseases and molecular screening. However, the use of
human blastocysts to generate ES cells raises many ethical problems. iPS
circumvent these ethical issues as they can be derived from differentiated
somatic tissues. Indeed, S. Yamanaka, Nobel Prize in 2012, discovered in
2006 a simple technique of cellular reprogramming. The transient
expression of four genes (OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4) is sufficient to
reprogram mouse fibroblasts into iPS. These iPS cells have the same
morphology and the same properties than ES cells. The following year, S.
Yamanaka applied successfully his cocktail to human fibroblasts to produce
human iPS (hiPS). hiPS may also overcome immunological problems raised by
the use of ES cell for cellular therapy, as hiPS can be derived from the
patient to be treated. In addition, it is easier to model genetic diseases
from hiPS than ES, because it is possible to choose the donor cells to
reprogram according to its genotype. Finally, from a pharmacological point
of view, hiPS can provide a broad platform of molecular screening to treat
various diseases. The aim of my research project is to use the hiPS
technology to model the development of bronchial epithelium. First, in
vivo, teratomas were formed by the injection of hiPS into immunodeficient
mice. Teratomas highlight the ability of differentiation of our hiPS into
bronchial epithelium. Second, in vitro, reproducing embryonic and foetal
bronchial development provides a way to model bronchial epithelium in a
dish. These techniques open the door to many potential research avenues
from screening small molecules to engineering stem cells to repair
bronchial epithelium, and will in fine promote new pharmacologic or cell-
based treatments for respiratory diseases.

RT   "Stabilising suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) protein
RT   levels to limit neointimal hyperplasia.";

AB   Yes
Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) is a potent inhibitor of the
mitogenic, migratory and pro-inflammatory pathways responsible for the
development of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH), a key contributor to the
failure of vascular reconstructive procedures. However, the protein levels
of SOCS3, and therefore its potential to reduce NIH, is limited by its
ubiquitylation and high turnover by the proteasome. I hypothesised that
stabilisation of endogenous SOCS3 by inhibiting its ubiquitylation has the
potential to limit vascular inflammation and NIH. Consequently, the aim of
this PhD was to identify the mechanisms promoting the rapid turnover of
SOCS3. Initial experiments involved the identification of residues
involved in regulating the turnover of SOCS3 at the proteasome. I assessed
the ubiquitylation status of a panel of FLAG tagged SOCS3 truncation
mutants and identified a C-terminal 44 amino acid region required for
SOCS3 ubiquitylation. This region localised to the SOCS box which is
involved in binding Elongin B/C and the formation of a functional E3
ubiquitin ligase complex. However, the single lysine residue at position
173, located within this 44 amino acid region, was not required for
ubiquitylation. Moreover, Emetine chase assays revealed that loss of
either Lys173 or Lys6 (as documented in the literature) had no significant
effect on SOCS3 stability 8 hrs post emetine treatment. As mutagenesis
studies failed to identify key sites of ubiquitylation responsible for
targeting SOCS3 to the proteasome, LC-MS-MS analysis of a SOCS3 co-
immunoprecipitate was employed. These data were searched for the presence
of a Gly-Gly doublet (+114 Da mass shift) and revealed 8 distinct sites of
ubiquitylation (Lys23, Lys28, Lys40, Lys85, Lys91, Lys173, Lys195, Lys206)
on SOCS3 however Lys6 ubiquitylation was not detected. As multiple Lys
residues were ubiquitylated, I hypothesised that only a Lys-less SOCS3, in
which all 8 Lys residues were mutated to Arg, would be resistant to
ubiquitylation. Compared to WT SOCS3, Lys-less SOCS3 was indeed found to
be completely resistant to ubiquitylation, and significantly more stable
than WT SOCS3. These changes occurred in the absence of any detrimental
effect on the ability of Lys-less SOCS3 to interact with the Elongin B/C
components required to generate a functional E3 ligase complex. In
addition, both WT and Lys-less SOCS3 were equally capable of inhibiting
cytokine-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation upon co-expression with a
chimeric EpoR-gp130 receptor. To assess whether SOCS3 auto-ubiquitylates I
generated an L189A SOCS3 mutant that could no longer bind the Elongins and
therefore form the E3 ligase complex required for ubiquitylation. A
denaturing IP to assess the ubiquitylation status of this mutant was
performed and revealed that, despite an inability to bind the Elongins,
the L189A mutant was poly-ubiquitylated similar to WT SOCS3. Together
these data suggested that SOCS3 does not auto-ubiquitylate and that a
separate E3 ligase must regulate SOCS3 ubiquitylation. This study sought
to identify the E3 ligase and deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes controlling
the ubiquitylation of SOCS3. Our initial strategy was to develop a tool to
screen an E3 ligase/DUB library, using an siARRAY, to sequentially
knockdown all known E3 ligases in the presence of a SOCS3-luciferase
fusion protein or endogenous SOCS3 in a high content imaging screening
platform. However, due to a poor assay window (<2) and non-specific
immunoreactivity of SOCS3 antibodies available, these methods were deemed
unsuitable for screening purposes. In the absence of a suitable tool to
screen the si-ARRAY, LC-MS-MS analysis of a SOCS3 co-immunoprecipitate (co-
IP) was investigated. I performed a SOCS3 under conditions which preserved
protein-protein interactions, with the aim of identifying novel E3 ligase
and/or DUBs that could potentially interact with SOCS3. These data were
searched for E3 ligase or DUB enzymes that may interact with SOCS3 in
HEK293 cells and identified two promising candidates i) an E3 ligase known
as HectD1 and ii) a DUB known as USP15. This thesis has demonstrated that
in the presence of HectD1 overexpression, a slight increase in K63-linked
polyubiquitylation of SOCS3 was observed. Mutagenesis also revealed that
an N-terminal region of SOCS3 may act as a repressor of this interaction
with HectD1. Additionally, USP15 was shown to reduce SOCS3
polyubiquitylation in a HEK293 overexpression system suggesting this may
act as a DUB for SOCS3. The C-terminal region of SOCS3 was also shown to
play a major role in the interaction with USP15. The original hypothesis
of this thesis was that stabilisation of endogenous SOCS3 by inhibiting
its ubiquitylation has the potential to limit vascular inflammation and
NIH. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunohistochemistry visualisation
of SOCS3, in human saphenous vein tissue derived from CABG patients,
revealed that while SOCS3 was present throughout the media of these
vessels the levels of SOCS3 within the neointima was reduced. Finally,
preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that SOCS3 overexpression may
limit the proliferation, but not migration, of human saphenous vein smooth
muscle cells (HSVSMCs) is presented. It is expected that multiple E3
ligases and DUBs will contribute to the regulation of SOCS3 turnover.
However, the identification of candidate E3 ligases or DUBs that play a
significant role in SOCS3 turnover may facilitate the development of
peptide disruptors or gene therapy targets to attenuate pathological SMC
proliferation. A targeted approach, inhibiting the interaction between
SOCS3 and identified E3 ligase, that controls the levels of SOCS3, would
be expected to reduce the undesirable effects associated with global
inhibition of the E3 ligase involved.

Diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) are severe diseases
affecting the pancreas. Current models for testing drugs to treat these
diseases are in vivo in rodents or isolated rodent islets. Differences
between the human and rodent pancreas, and ethical issues, mean that in
vitro human models are needed. To develop a novel in vitro model for
pancreatic diseases, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from the pancreas of patients with CHI.
MSCs from three forms of CHI were phenotypically normal for MSCs, and
maintained the CHI-causing mutation. When compared to MSCs from bone
marrow, the CHI pancreatic MSCs expressed pancreas-specific gene ISL1 and
showed promoter hypomethylation of other pancreatic genes, including PDX1.
The CHI pMSCs could be differentiated to cells resembling immature beta-
cells, with some beta-cell gene expression (INS, PDX1), but no glucose
responsive insulin secretion. CHI associated hypersecretion of insulin was
not seen as the ATP-sensitive potassium KATP channels were not being
expressed. Addition of the Wnt inhibitor DKK1 markedly enhanced
differentiation via induction of neuronal genes. Alongside high insulin
secretion, CHI also features increased proliferation. CHI MSCs were also
hyperproliferative, and showed alterations to the cell cycle. These
changes were related to p27Kip1 localisation, a known affected protein in
CHI tissue, and CDK1, a novel regulator for CHI. iPSCs were also derived
from focal CHI MSCs and were also phenotypically normal, but did not
maintain the pancreatic hypomethylation present in MSCs. The CHI iPSCs
were efficiently differentiated to definitive endoderm and PDX1 positive
cells. Terminally differentiated iPSCs were endocrine, but were not mature
beta-cells. In conclusion, authentic MSCs and iPSCs were derived for the
first time from patients with CHI. These stem cells could be
differentiated towards beta-cells, but mature glucose responsive beta-
cells were not produced. MSC derived beta-like cells secreted insulin but
did not have KATP channels, whereas iPSC derived beta-like cells had KATP
channel gene expression but not INS. With further optimisation to resolve
these, CHI stem cell derived beta-cells may be used for in vitro modelling.
Further, the undifferentiated MSCs only show hyperproliferation associated
with p27Kip1 and CDK1 and so can be a useful resource for modelling
hyperproliferation seen in CHI.

Normal salivary processes are vital to the health of a patient. The
salivary fluid has important functions such as digestion, lubrification,
antibacterial protection and tooth remineralization. Salivary glands
dysfunction such as hyposalivation can be observed in patients undergoing
radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, and in patients suffering from
Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease. Symptoms of hyposalivation
include xerostomia (dry mouth), oral infections, tooth decay, pain,
dysgeusia (distortion of taste) and disrupted speech. Numerous drugs and
cell therapies have been proposed to reverse the impaired glandular
secretion. Among the tools used for such research is the HSG cell line,
commonly used in salivary gland research and mistakenly labeled as a
submandibular ductal cell cell line. ATCC has recently released a list of
cell lines cross-contaminated by HeLa, that included HSG. Despite the
notice, some salivary gland research labs still use HSG. In this work, we
describe the methodology for authenticating cell lines, assess the
validity of previous HSG findings and develop a new salivary gland cell
line. Objectives-We examine the authenticity and purity of two samples of
HSG obtained from two independent labs using STR analysis. A literature
review on HeLa cells is conducted to determine the validity of using HeLa-
derived cells, namely HSG, as a model for salivary gland cells to support
past salivary gland research findings that resulted from HSG. Lastly, a
new human submandibular salivary gland cell line will be established and
characterized. Results: STR analysis: HSG-Tran and HSG-Delporte have > 0.80
match with HeLa in DSMZ database. This confirms that both cell lines share
a common ancestry (host) with HeLa. Literature review-based on reports of
the karyotyping, cellular markers and membrane barrier function, HSG
(HeLa) is not an appropriate model of normal human salivary gland
acinar/ducal cells. Due to advanced mutations, it is even fair to say that
HeLa is no longer a valid representation of human biology. Cell line
establishment-The morphology of the SV40LT transfected salivary gland
cells (SMG-hu-1) is highly similar to the non-transfected cells, both with
an epithelial-like cobblestone morphology. SMG-hu-1 cells proliferate
steadily (passage 10+) whereas non-transfected cells enter senescence
after passage 1. Under immunofluorescence, SMG-hu-1 cells are positive for
epithelial markers E-cadherin and cytokeratin. In turn, they are negative
for vimentin (mesenchymal), CD31 (endothelial), alpha-smooth muscle actin
(myoepithelial). AQP5 (serous acinar) staining is inconclusive. RNA
expression reveals CK5, AQP5 and SV40. CFTR and CK19 expression are not
found.

Conclusions: STR analysis reveals that HSG is a HeLa derived cell line.
Furthermore, as genotyping of the original cell line was not performed
during its establishment, it will be impossible to authenticate a cell
line that is supposedly an uncontaminated sample of HSG. Similarly, based
on its characteristics and properties, HeLa derived cells, such as HSG,
are not an accurate model of salivary gland cells. The use of HSG in
salivary gland research should be discontinued and past findings should be
reassessed with an accurate model, such as our newly established human
submandibular salivary gland cell line (SMG-hu-1). SMG-hu-1 cells share
the epithelial morphology of its non-transfected counterpart, but with
significantly higher replicative capabilities. Immunofluorescence reveals
presence of E-cadherin and cytokeratin. PCR and RT-PCR reveals expression
of CK5, AQP5 and SV40. By utilizing this cell line, we look to further
investigate salivary processes in hope to develop a cure to hyposalivation.

Methylmalonic aciduria is caused by mutations affecting the mitochondrial
enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, the synthesis of its cofactor,
adenosylcobalamin, and certain other steps in propionyl-CoA metabolism.
Biallelic mutations in the MUT gene, which encodes methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase, are responsible for the mut form of methylmalonic aciduria.
Patients with this disorder present symptoms of metabolic acidosis,
failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, hypotonia, lethargy, and
dehydration in the newborn period. Nearly 330 MUT gene mutations are known
to cause mut methylmalonic aciduria. In this study, a next generation
sequencing based gene panel recently developed at Baylor Miraca Genetics
Laboratories was used to analyze 53 patients that had been diagnosed with
mut methylmalonic aciduria by somatic cell complementation analysis. A
total of 54 different mutations in MUT were identified in 48 of 53 (91%)
patients. Of these, 16 mutations were novel, including the largest
insertion mutation in the MUT gene to date. Phenotypic rescue studies and
analysis of cDNA were used to confirm that the large insertion was
responsible for the MCM deficiency observed in the patient's fibroblasts.
No MUT gene mutations were detected in 5 of 53 (9%) patients. Review of
the cellular complementation data used to initially diagnosis these
patients showed the results to be equivocal, putting the initial mut
diagnosis into question. One patient was found to carry two novel
mutations in the SUCLG1 gene which are likely responsible for the
patient's phenotype. Another patient was found to carry a novel
heterozygous variant in SUCLG2. Deficiency of SUCLG2 was investigated in
cells from this patient as a novel cause of human disease. In conclusion,
combination of gene panel analysis and somatic cell studies provided
optimal diagnoses for this cohort of patients.

Insect cell lines are convenient and powerful tools that were initially
used in viral propagation, optimization of viral pesticides, cell-virus
interactions, and recombinant protein productions. The most commonly used
cell lines were initiated from embryonic tissues, nervous system, and
ovarian tissues. Although the midgut is known as the main entry of
pathogens and pest control chemicals, few cell lines have been established
from midgut tissues of economically important pests. My project focused on
establishing midgut cell lines from four select species, including western
corn rootworm, southern green stinkbug, green stinkbug, and fall armyworm.
I in total initiated 317 cell cultures from the four insect species, of
these 21 promising cell cultures are still being carefully maintained. I
established two midgut cell lines from the fall armyworm that are
continuously replicating. Additionally, experiences and new insights of
cell culture initiations from western corn rootworm and (southern) green
stinkbug were gained. Characterization of the two SfMG cell lines verified
their identities belonging to S. frugiperda. The doubling time of the two
cell lines indicate they are relatively fast replicating. I optimized the
cell cytotoxicity assay based on cell sensitivity and linear relationship
for use in future toxin-screening assays.

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell dyscrasia characterized
by recurrent translocations into immunoglobulin loci and a unique V(D)J
rearrangement signature that can be used to track disease over time.
Modern myeloma therapy results in high response rates, however the
majority of patients still relapse, suggesting persistence of minimal
residual disease (MRD) beyond current limits of detection. We developed a
targeted-capture approach to detect V(D)J rearrangements and recurrent
immunoglobulin translocations to enable MRD assessment. We validated this
assay in 69 human myeloma cell lines and established a limit of detection
of 1/1000 DNA fragments. Our methods agree with MRD measured by multi-
parameter flow cytometry in 11/14 patient samples. One sample was MRD
positive by MFC and negative by targeted-capture sequencing, two were
positive by sequencing and negative by MFC. Targeted capture sequencing is
an alternative strategy to MRD detection and has potential applications
for disease monitoring and immune repertoire profiling.

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are predominantly anthropogenically-
derived chemicals, characterized by their persistence, toxicity, capacity
for bioaccumulation and tendency for long-range environmental transport.
They have been observed at elevated concentrations in polar environments
and biota, including Antarctic foraging humpback whales (Megaptera
novaeangliae). Southern hemisphere humpback whales are highly dependent on
lipid reserves accumulated during summer feeding to sustain their seasonal
migration and associated period of voluntary fasting, the longest known in
any mammal. This extreme life-history behaviour has been observed to
result in a dramatic increase in blubber POP concentrations and presumed
circulating lipophilic POP burdens during times of negative energy balance.
Toxicological investigations of the effect of circulating POP burdens are,
however, constrained by logistical challenges associated with large
cetacean research, and the limitations of existing non-lethal research
approaches. This thesis research was designed to develop a humpback whale
derived fibroblast cell culture for species-specific assessment of the
toxicological impact of priority POPs and other potential stressors.

Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-cytotoxic agent (DM1)
conjugated drug. DM1 delivery by trastuzumab inside the HER2 positive
cells affects microtubule polymerization, cell cycle arrest and finally
cell death. Although T-DM1 is approved for the treatment of HER2 positive
metastatic breast cancer patients, primary and acquired resistance towards
this drug is still a main challenge. Looking for the mechanisms of
resistance is necessary to improve patient selection and to develop novel
treatment strategies. Here, we focused on finding mechanisms of acquired
resistance to T-DM1 in a panel of HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines
(HCC1954, HCC1419 and SKBR3 parental vs. resistant cells) generated by an
established protocol of T-DM1 exposure, increasing the concentration of T-DM1
[1-4 mug/mL], 3 days on/3 days off, for 54 days overall. We generated
acquired resistant cells with different level of resistance to T-DM1
evaluated by 3, 7 and 10 days proliferation assay, using automated cell
counting in SKBR3, HCC1419 and HCC1954 parental and the acquired resistant
cells. Analysis of T-DM1 effects on cell cycle showed a significant
induction of G2/M arrest in the parental cells, while this effect was not
observed in the resistant cells. Expression/activity analysis of cyclin
B1/CDK1 complex, the main apparatus involve in G2/M cell cycle arrest
induction, showed a remarkable decrease in the basal level of cyclin B1 in
the resistant cells. Cyclin B1 accumulation induced by T-DM1 in the
parental cells was not observed in the resistant cells. CDK1 activity
assay was also correlated with cyclin B1 expression, increasing following
T-DM1 treatment in the parental cells, but not in the resistant cells.
Functional analysis revealed that cyclin B1 knock down in the parental
cells induced a significant T-DM1 resistance. Furthermore, the silencing
of cdc20, a protein mainly involved in APC complex related cyclin B1
degradation, could sensitize the resistant cells to T-DM1. Finally, cyclin
B1 induction by T-DM1 was confirmed in in vivo and ex vivo xenograft
animal model and patients' explants, respectively. By cyclin B1 induction
pattern, we could categorize T-DM1 responsive/non-responsive in fresh
breast cancer explants from HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Our
results showed that T-DM1 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in a cyclin
B1/CDK1 dependent-manner. Lack of these effects appeared in acquired T-DM1
resistant cells. Besides, similar pattern in G2/M and cyclin B1 was
verified in vivo and in patients explants. These data strongly suggest
that induction of cyclin B1 is necessary for T-DM1 antitumor effects and
emerges as a potential pharmacodynamic marker. Our finding also raises the
question on what are the mechanisms leading to cyclin B1 dysregulation in
resistant cells.

Helicases process the double-stranded DNA dissociation. They are involved
in replication, DNA repair and maintenance of telomeres. In human, 3
helicases display mutations responsible for clinical syndromes: WRN for
the Werner syndrome, BLM for the Bloom syndrome and RECQL4 for the
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. All these diseases cause premature ageing and
high risk of cancer. Molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these
diseases are not well defined. Particularly, little is known concerning
the link between genomic instability and ageing. During this project, we
used blood samples and skin biopsies of affected patients to generate
models by reprogramming cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
These cells have the advantage of self-renewing and theoretically could be
differentiated in all cell types. At the same time, an iPSC senescence
control was performed from cells of a Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome
patient. iPSCs were characterized for pluripotency. In the aim of
recapitulate these pathologies in vitro, we identified sets of cellular
and molecular phenotypes. We also engaged differentiation of iPSCs in cell
pathways closed to the affected tissues in vivo. Finally, we studied the
genomic stability of iPSCs and derived cells. We observed that Bloom cells
are susceptible to frequent recombinations and are characterized by a
genome instability through all studied cell types. Werner cells showed an
instability of telomeres length. Finally, all premature ageing diseases
displayed mitochondrial defects.

A defining characteristic of alphaherpesviruses is the establishment of
lifelong latency in host sensory ganglia with occasional reactivation
causing recurrent lytic infections. Much remains unknown regarding the
cellular and viral mechanisms involved in HSV exit from latency. We
hypothesize that VP16 recruits chromatin-remodeling enzymes to immediate
early gene promoters on compact-latent chromatin as a necessary step for
reactivation. In order to test this hypothesis, a robust in vitro assay in
which HSV latency can be established in neurons was required. In this
dissertation, I explored the use of a human sensory neuron cell line as a
novel in vitro model of HSV-1 latency and reactivation. HD10.6 cells were
derived from embryonic human dorsal root ganglia and immortalized by a
tetracycline-regulated v-myc oncogene. HD10.6 cells mature to express a
sensory neuron-associated phenotype when treated with doxycycline which
suppresses proliferation mediated by the v-myc oncogene. Infection at a
low MOI in the presence of acyclovir results in a quiescent infection
resembling latency in matured cells. HD10.6 cells provide a novel context
in which to study the host and viral mechanisms of HSV-1 latency
establishment, maintenance, and reactivation.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) is a heterogeneous
cancer at the genetic and cellular levels. Whole exome-sequencing studies
have identified inactivating mutations in NOTCH1 in 11-15% of SCCHN. It
was the aim of this research to correlate genetic changes in NOTCH1
expression with changes in cell behaviour. A human oral SCC line
harbouring two truncating NOTCH1 mutations was rescued via lentiviral
transduction of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD). In vitro assays
provided evidence to suggest that expression of NICD was able to inhibit
proliferation, clonogenicity and cell migration into a scratch wound. At
high expression levels, NICD also promoted differentiation. Microarray
data supported the in vitro findings and further associated NOTCH1
expression with increased cell death and decreased angiogenesis. SERPINE 1
was highlighted as a potential regulator of NICD-mediated changes in cell
behaviour. A high number of histone related genes were also found to be
down-regulated in response to increased NICD expression. These findings
were not explored further in this thesis but are of interest for future
work. Microarray analysis also identified SPANXA1/2 as the most up-
regulated gene in response to NICD expression. The fold change increase of
SPANXA1/2 was 3x that of any other gene. In order to investigate the
functional consequence of SPANXA1/2 expression, a shRNA system was used to
knockdown SPANXA1/2 in the NICD-rescued cell line. Primary findings
provide evidence to associate the expression of SPANXA1/2 with a potential
increase in cell proliferation, increased cell migration into a scratch
wound and a change in cell morphology. Current literature suggests that
changes in cell morphology may be associated with the inhibition of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the induction of
mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). However, data is preliminary
and further studies are required to confirm this association. A murine
xenograft model was established to assess tumour formation in vivo. The
expression of NICD resulted in significantly larger tumours. However, no
difference in proliferation was recorded over the two hour period prior to
sacrifice. Histological observations also suggest that the expression of
NICD may be associated with reduced keratin pearl formation and increased
areas of what pathologically presents as comedo-type necrosis. Finally,
the expression of NICD was not found to give rise to any significant
difference in angiogenesis. Together, these findings suggest a tumour
suppressor role for NOTCH1 in SCCHN.

Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder worldwide and a
major health problem. Islet transplantation has been a successful
treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, the potential of
transplantation-based therapy is currently limited by the shortage of
transplantable material from human donors. New sources of insulin-
secreting cells are being investigated, such as human embryonic stem
cells, induced pluripotent stem cells or adult stem/progenitor cells. The
aim of this study was to assess the differentiation potential of a novel
human pancreatic progenitor cell line (Nes160). The effects of the small
molecule inducer of differentiation isoxazole [3,5-disubstituted isoxazole;
N-cyclopropyl-5-(thiophen-2-yl)isoxazole-3-carboxamide] on promoting cell
differentiation in Nes160 cells towards a mature endocrine lineage were
investigated in this study. The effects of isoxazole on Nes160 cells were
evaluated by establishing a gene expression profile. Results of RT-PCR and
qPCR analyses showed that treatment with isoxazole successfully induced
pro-differentiation effects in Nes160 cells, by inducing/enhancing
expression of transcription factors important to initiate the endocrine
developmental program and to promote beta-cell maturation such as PDX1,
NGN3, NEUROD1, PAX4 and NKX6.1. Isoxazole treatment even promoted the
formation of cluster-like aggregates in Nes160 cells. A larger study of
the effects of isoxazole on Nes160 cells was conducted by performing
microarray analysis on RNA samples collected from cells treated with
isoxazole during two different time points and their corresponding time-
matched controls. This analysis allowed the identification of 340
differentially expressed genes after two days of treatment with isoxazole
and 425 after six days of treatment, compared to DMSO-vehicle controls and
using a cutoff filter of >= 3 fold change for both, up and down-regulated
genes. Functional analysis and processes related to the differentially
expressed genes were determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and
gene ontology classification (PANTHER) software. Results of those analyses
showed that the biological processes that were altered by the effects of
isoxazole corresponded to cell communication and cell development; and the
pathways that were activated were related to remodelling of the actin
cytoskeleton, transcriptional regulation, and cell movement. The results
presented in this study show the potential of isoxazole to induce pro-
differentiation effects and the plasticity of the Nes160 cells to initiate
the pancreatic endocrine program. Further studies are needed to elucidate
how to achieve a fully mature and functional beta-like cell phenotype in
Nes160 cells.

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is an understudied, unique subtype of
breast cancer. E-cadherin (CDH1) loss is a hallmark of ILC that
contributes to its many observed epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT)-like features. Though ILCs predominantly express clinically
actionable target estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), common late recurrences
suggest a role for endocrine therapy resistance. We recently identified de
novo resistance to the partial estrogen receptor antagonist/agonist
Tamoxifen (4OHT) in MDA-MB-134-VI ILC cells that was accompanied by
upregulation of EMT transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL (SNAI1). We
therefore hypothesized that 4OHT induction of SNAIL contributes to
endocrine therapy resistance in a subset of ILCs. We demonstrated estrogen
induction of SNAI1 in multiple invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ILC
cell lines. In contrast, 4OHT induction of SNAI1 was restricted to ILC
cells tested, and was associated with recruitment of ERa to the SNAI1
promoter. We observed upregulation of additional EMT genes in ILC cells,
partially translatable to clinical samples. However, 4OHT regulation of
SNAIL was unique, thus we pursued study of SNAIL-mediated phenotypes in
ILC cells. Unfortunately, manipulation of SNAIL levels in ILC cells was
challenging, with expression rebound in stable constitutive
knockdown/overexpression attempts. Inducible SNAIL overexpression revealed
unexpected repression of 2D and 3D proliferation. These data suggest a
role for SNAIL in unexplored, critical ILC phenotypes (e.g. tumor
dormancy). Lack of ILC models for these studies highlighted need for novel
ILC cell lines. We therefore established and characterized ILC cell line
WCRC-25 from a pleural effusion from a patient with ER+ ILC. WCRC-25
maintained phenotypes consistent with other ILC cells (e.g. slow
proliferation, poor soft agar formation). We identified a somatic CDH1
mutation (2240C>T, p.Q706*) in gDNA from WCRC-25 that we confirmed in
liquid biopsies from the patient. DNA/RNA sequencing analyses are being
performed using clinical samples from the patient. While loss of ER
impeded testing endocrine therapy resistance in WCRC-25 cells, additional
drug responses revealed sensitivity to a PI3K inhibitor. In summary, these
studies provided the foundation for better understanding of the role of
EMT-TF SNAIL in endocrine therapy resistance, and led to establishment and
characterization of a novel ILC research tool.

The abiraterone acetate (AA) is a drug used to castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CPRC) treatment. The introduction of AA in therapy
significantly increased the survival of patients with CPRC. However, AA
resistance development is common in most of the patients. Therefore, the
development of an AA-resistant cell line is useful for understanding the
molecular mechanisms involved in this process and to the development of
novel therapeutic agents. An AA-resistant cell line was established from
the LNCAP cell line after incubated with increasing AA concentration until
reaches the IC50 for the cell line. After that, the resistant confirmation
and characterization of the cell line were proceeded. The fold-resistance
and cell proliferation rate were performed by MTT assay. Cell cycle
distribution and express of cancer stem cells markers (CD133 and CD44)
were evaluated by FACS analysis. In comparison to parental cell line, the
AA-resistant cell line has a slower growth rate and a 1,4-fold increase in
resistance to AA. No differences were observed regarding to cell cycle
distribution, cell morphology, and expression of CD133 and CD44 markers
between the resistant and parental cell lines. Additional characterization
parameters such as specific miRNAs expression and ARV7 protein expression
are still required. Therefore, an AA resistance induction in a prostate
cancer cell line (LNCAP) was achieved as well as the cell line
characterization, at least in part, allowing further studies of new
resistance mechanisms and new treatment strategies.

Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) is an endosomal receptor found highly
expressed in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). It is
activated by unmethylated CpG DNA and synthetic CpG
oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines
(TNFalpha, IL-12) and type I interferons (IFNs). It senses viral and
bacterial pathogens and activates adaptive immune responses. Dysregulation
of TLR9 signaling can lead to progression and regression of various
cancers and autoimmune diseases. Thus, modulation of TLR9 activity is an
attractive target for immunotherapy. Due to scarcity of pDCs in the blood
and a lack of a suitable model for studying of TLR9, knowledge about this
receptor is lacking. The goal of this project was to characterize two
experimental model cell lines (THP-1 TLR9 mCherry and CAL-1 TLR9 mCherry)
for in vitro studies of TLR9, use them to study TLR9 expression,
trafficking and signaling in pDC-like cells and investigate the role of
Rab11a and Rab39a in these processes. Both cell lines express doxycycline-
inducible TLR9 mCherry. The results showed that IL-4, GM-CSF-
differentiated THP-1 TLR9 mCherry cells resemble immature dendritic cells
in their ability to induce IFNbeta1 and TNFalpha in response to CpG ODNs.
Undifferentiated CAL-1 TLR9 mCherry cells potently induced IFNbeta1 in
response to CpG ODNs, validating their pDC-like properties. In IL-4,
GM-CSF-differentiated THP-1 TLR9 mCherry cells TLR9 was primarily found in
LAMP1-positive vesicles (late endosomes/lysosomes) before and after
stimulation, indicating that TLR9 may reside and interact with its ligands
in late endosomes. In CAL-1 TLR9 mCherry cells, the majority of TLR9
colocalized with late endosomes/lysosomes before and after stimulation
with CpG ODN 2216, a CpG ligand thought to signal from early endosomes.
Stimulation of TLR9 with CpG ODN 2006, a CpG ligand thought to signal from
late endosomes, in CAL-1 TLR9 mCherry cells led to a decrease in TLR9-
LAMP1 colocalization, indicating that TLR9 may be signaling and
interacting with this ligand from other endosomal compartments. Rab11a
regulates TLR4-induced IRF3 activation and IFNbeta production, but its
role in TLR9 signaling is unknown. Rab39a has been identified as a
potential regulator of TLR9 signaling, but its exact role is still unclear.
The results showed that both Rab11a and Rab39a may potentially play a role
in TLR9-induced IFNbeta1 signaling in IL-4, GM-CSF-differentiated THP-1
TLR9 mCherry cells. However, further experiments are required to validate
these findings. In conclusion, the ability to study TLR9 expression,
subcellular localization and response upon ligand stimulation, makes both
THP-1 TLR9 mCherry and CAL-1 TLR9 mCherry cells promising experimental
models for studying TLR9 signaling and trafficking in vitro.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of innate immune receptors that
function to mount an immune response upon recognition of molecules
associated with infection or injury. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is
expressed predominantly in endosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDCs), where it is responsible for recognition of unmethylated CpG DNA
derived from virus or bacteria. Activated TLR9 initiates immune responses
which are important in antiviral immunity. Upon activation, TLR9 locates
to early endosomes and initiates the production of interferons (IFNs)
through transcription factor IRF7. Further sorting of TLR9 to late
endosomes stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines like
TNFalpha and IL-12B through transcription factor NF-kappaB. In pDCs, TLR9
can trigger potent anti-tumor immunity, however, the receptor has also
been found involved in driving tumor progression. Since pDCs are rare in
the human blood, this project sought to establish and characterize a model
cell system that resembles human pDCs. A THP-1 cell line with inducible
expression of TLR9 mCherry was characterized and optimized for studying
TLR9 signaling and trafficking. Different differentiation protocols were
applied to the THP-1 TLR9 mCherry cells before cells were induced to
express TLR9 and stimulated with CpG. PMA differentiation of these cells
failed to produce a potent IFNbeta1 response in response to CpG. In
contrast, GM-CSF and IL-4-differentiated and undifferentiated THP-1 TLR9
mCherry cells mimicked pDC responses and induced marked levels of
IFNbeta1, as well as TNFalpha, in response to CpG. Previous findings in
HEK293 cells indicated a role for the GTPase Rab39a in TLR9 signaling.
Undifferentiated THP-1 TLR9 mCherry cells were used as a model cell line
for studying how Rab39a silencing might affect TLR9 signaling. siRNA
experiments targeting Rab39a revealed an increased tendency of IFNbeta1
and TNFalpha mRNA levels in response to CpG in undifferentiated THP-1 TLR9
mCherry cells. Combined, this project provides a novel model system to
study TLR9 signaling and trafficking and suggests that Rab39a might be
involved in regulation of signaling from TLR9.

Although lung cancer is a common disease, its diagnosis remains poor.
While the incidence of lung cancer has decreased in western countries,
lung cancer rates are predicted to increase generally in Asia. Studies
investigating the mutation patterns of Asian cases compared with Caucasian
types, lack adequate resources. Especially, lung cancer cell lines that
are acquired from pleural effusion exudates are rare in cell line models.
Pleural effusions in patients with NSCLC show progressive status and
malignant features. In our study, 28 lung cancer cell lines derived from
pleural effusions were newly established and their cellular and molecular
characteristics were analyzed. Representative mutations in BRAF, EGFR,
ERBB2, FGFR4, KRAS and TP53 as well as fusions such as ALK, CD74 and RET
genes were detected and validated. Based on mutation profiles, drug
sensitivities to gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib were measured. Cell
lines that carry target mutations to each drug are generally sensitive.
Cell lines originating from pleural effusions are relatively more
resistant than cell lines derived from tissues that harbor similar
mutation. Analysis of mutational pattern and drug sensitivity of these
cell lines can facilitate database construction for case study. Expression
levels of specific oncoproteins such as ERK, ERBB2, c-MET and PTEN were
detected in our cell lines. EMT markers such as EpCAM, E-cadherin,
N-cadherin and Vimentin were also detected. These 28 well characterized lung
cancer cell lines originating from malignant pleural effusions support
studies associated with sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs and
representative mutations in lung cancers. the few experimental results and
small patient numbers still limit our knowledge of the acquired resistance
to crizotinib. To meet this need, we established crizotinib-resistant
sublines. Their parental cell lines were derived from a pleural effusion
exudate which was thought to be more aggressive and resistant to anti-
cancer drugs.

wide variety of physiological functions of the cell. Many of these
transporters are also implicated in cancer drug resistance. ABCB5 has been
described as a marker of skin progenitor cells, melanoma stem cells, and
limbal stem cells. It was reported to be a mediator of multidrug
resistance in many cancers including melanoma. More recent data also
suggest a role of ABCB5 in tumor development and progression. Although
eleven transcripts of human ABCB5 have been identified, including two long
transcripts named ABCB5FL (full-length) and ABCB5beta, the transporter
remains little characterized and its subcellular localization has not been
validated yet. This research project is divided in two parts. First, it
aims to generate an ABCB5-knockout human melanoma cell line to create a
powerful tool better characterize the ABCB5 transporter. Second, it aims
to use this ABCB5-knockout cell line to pursue the study of the ABCB5
subcellular localization. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool will be
employed to knockout the ABCB5 gene, by removing either a fragment of 53
kb or 125 kb. For that purpose, high quality guide RNAs will be selected
to target specific regions of the gene and to limit the risk of off-target
effects. The ABCB5-knockout cell lines will be validated at the genomic
level by PCR and sequencing, and at the proteic level by Western Blot. The
latter will also serve to prove the specificity of the anti-ABCB5
antibodies. The method of cell fractionation described by de Duve et al.
will be used to study the ABCB5 subcellular localization.We successfully
obtained cell lines with a biallelic 53 kb deletion and cell lines with a
monoallelic 125 kb deletion in ABCB5. Both have been validated at the
genomic level by PCR and sequencing, and the proteic validation is being
performed. We performed a first set of cell fractionation on the MelJuso
parental cell line to optimize the method and to establish a first
distribution profile of ABCB5. Although we have detected an enrichment of
ABCB5 in the nuclear and microsomal fractions, our results remain
hypothetical. Indeed, the anti-ABCB5 antibody used in the experiment is a
polyclonal antibody, which recognizes many other proteins. After
validating the specificity of the antibody by Western Blot, we will
perform a second fractionation on both ABCB5-expressing and ABCB5-knockout
Mel-Juso cell lines to strenghten the current data on the transporter
localization.

Compared to other breast cancers (BC), triple negative breast cancers
(TNBCs) confer lower survival and higher disease recurrence. TNBCs lack
receptors targeted by current therapies, requiring new therapeutic target
identification. Recently, the ribosome biogenesis protein WDR12 was
identified as a potential target from RNAi databases. WDR12 belongs to the
WD40-repeat family of scaffolding proteins, which have become interesting
targets due to their druggable structure. I hypothesized that TNBC cell
lines would be more sensitive to WDR12 knockdown (KD) due to their
increased rate of ribosome biogenesis. WDR12 depletion led to decreased
proliferation in all BC cell lines that could not be attributed to
apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, WDR12 KD decreased
nucleolar size to a greater extent in TNBC, indicating a potential role
for WDR12 in ribosome biogenesis. In conclusion, WDR12 may be a promising
therapeutic target in TNBC, although additional confirmatory testing will
be required.

Sezary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukaemic variant of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). After the tumour suppressor gene TP53, PLCG1 is the
most frequently mutated gene in CTCL. PLCgamma1 (encoded by PLCG1) is
fundamental in Tcell receptor (TCR) signalling as it hydrolyses a plasma
membrane component to trigger pathways that induce NFkappaB, NFAT and AP-1
transcriptional activity. This thesis aimed to functionally interrogate
nine PLCgamma1 mutations (p.R48W, p.S312L, p.D342N, p.S345F, p.S520F,
p.R1158H, p.E1163K, p.D1165H and the indel p.VYEEDM1161V) identified in SS.
PLCG1 mutations detected in diagnostic samples persisted in multiple
tumour compartments several months after diagnosis, suggesting that these
are likely driver gene mutations. A comprehensive analysis of whole-exome
and targeted gene sequencing studies in addition to database
interrogations revealed frequent PLCG1 mutations in 7/10 different types
of mature T-cell lymphomas and highlighted five hotspot mutations. In
basal conditions, five mutant proteins directly increased PLCgamma1
activity by elevating inositol phosphate production and significantly
enhanced downstream NFkappaB and NFAT activity, demonstrating bona fide
gain-of-function properties. The hotspot p.R48W protein required
stimulation to significantly elevate NFkappaB activity. Four activating
mutations mapped to the PLCgamma2 protein surface that likely interacts with
the plasma membrane. These four mutant proteins are hypothesised to have
increased access to substrate, resulting in augmented TCR signalling.
Abrogation of the key PLCgamma1 phosphorylation residue did not influence
the elevated NFkappaB, NFAT and AP-1 activity induced by gain-of-function
proteins in basal conditions or NFkappaB activity in stimulated cells,
suggesting that the mutant proteins act in a phosphorylation-independent
manner. The indel in the C2 domain of PLCgamma1 reduced total protein
expression but importantly mediated gain-of-function, proposing a novel
and critical role for this domain in regulating protein activity. An
IKKbeta inhibitor was ineffective at reducing PLCgamma1-induced NFkappaB
activity. In conclusion, PLCG1 mutations frequently occur in mature T-cell
lymphomas and persist in multiple tumour tissues throughout the course of
disease in SS. Five mutant proteins potently activate proximal and distal
signalling independently of extracellular stimuli and contribute to the
dysregulated TCR signalling that is characteristic of CTCL. The data
presented here provides compelling evidence for the development of novel
mutation-specific PLCgamma1 inhibitors.

Introduction: Resistance to platinum-based therapy develops in most
patients treated for High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC), a fact that
largely accounts for this disease's elevated mortality. It was previously
shown by Cooke and colleagues (Oncogene, 2010) that platinum (Pt)
resistance results from the expansion of sub-clonal populations of
resistant cells present prior to treatment. Current in vitro models of Pt-
resistance may be confounded by a lack of fidelity to the genetic
signature of HGSOC, or by the methods used to elicit the onset of
resistance which may lack clinical relevance. This project aims to address
whether Pt-resistance can be evolved from a population of Pt-sensitive
cells exposed to cisplatin (CDDP) in a clinically relevant manner using
patient-derived cell lines such as PEO1. The central aim was to uncover
what heterogeneity might exist within this cell line and to determine if
in vitro derived Pt-resistance can result from the selection of pre-
existent subsets of cells as occurs in vivo.

Methods: The Pt-sensitivity of the cell lines used, was established by
exposing cells in culture to CDDP for 1 hr. Live cell number and percent
viability were assessed 72 hours after drug removal using Guava
microcytometry. Long-term assessment of Pt toxicity was provided by use of
the clonogenic survival assay. To achieve Pt-resistance in vitro, a
culture of PEO1 was exposed to 10 muM CDDP for 1 hour and allowed to
repopulate. These cells were passaged and used to establish a novel cell
line (PEO1X) with 20-fold diminished Pt-sensitivity confirmed via the
clonogenic survival assay. PEO1X cells were assayed for histopathological
and cell-fate markers by immunohistochemistry and compared to PEO1.
Migratory capacity was assessed via the Boyden chamber method, while cell
cycle status 72 hours after CDDP exposure was interrogated using propidium
iodide staining. Doubling time was also determined, and a partial genetic
signature was established by sequencing a panel of 33 cancer-related genes.

Results: PEO1 exhibits morphological asymmetry, with a dichotomy between
epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. This is further evidenced by the
heterogeneous expression of markers such as E-cadherin, vimentin and CA125.
Although similar to PEO1 in proliferation rate, PEO1X cells possess
obvious differences in morphology, being smaller and more homogenously
rounded in appearance with altered expression of markers such as
E-cadherin, vimentin, CA125 and CD133. Unlike PEO1, the cell cycle status of
PEO1X is barely altered 72 hrs following CDDP exposure even at 10 muM.
PEO1X also possesses a more migratory phenotype than PEO1 with
significantly more cells transiting through the pores of the Boyden
chamber membrane in 30 hrs. Sequencing revealed heterogeneity in the
status of P53 in PEO1 with PEO1X being slightly enriched in P53 WT
expressing cells. Interestingly, the gene NF1, encoding the tumor-
suppressor neurofibromin was found to contain an indel mutation in PEO1
and PEO1X while containing a different loss-of-function point mutation in
PEO4 and being WT in PEO6 despite all being established from the same
patient.

Conclusions: The cell line PEO1 contains a sub-population of Pt-
resistant cells that can be selected for, in vitro, by clinically relevant
CDDP treatment. These cells are distinct from those having emerged
clinically in the original patient.

Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer of adolescents with 400 cases
diagnosed annually in the United States. Early metastatic spread to the
lungs is a hallmark feature of the disease, and is detrimental to overall
survival of the patient. It is believed that upwards of 80% of patients
have micrometastasis at the time of diagnosis. Gaining an understanding of
the mechanisms responsible for metastasis is hugely important for the
development of new therapies.

We used an approach to study osteosarcoma metastasis that involved the
acquisition of patient tumors from both the primary site and metastatic
site for whole genome and RNA sequencing, PDX production, and cell line
production. Phenotypic characterization of the PDX and cell lines in vivo
revealed that many will metastasize spontaneously and in a tail vein
injection model. RNA seq data revealed a list of genes that are enriched
in metastasis, including several genes such as FOXA1 that have previously
been described in cancer, but never OS.

The function of ENPP1, a gene that is highly expressed in OS was also
evaluated. ENPP1 expression correlated with metastatic capability in
numerous OS cell lines in an in vivo tail vein injection model. Gain and
loss of function studies firmly established ENPP1's role in OS growth and
metastasis. Our data described a role of ENPP1 in OS metastasis for the
first time.

The ability of IL-12 to affect both innate and adaptive immunity positions
this cytokine as a promising candidate to overcome the immunosuppressive
microenvironment within tumours. Despite its potent activity in
experimental models, the clinical use of IL 12 has been thwarted by its
reported toxicity in human trials. Intranasal administration of an IL-12-
coding lentivirus efficiently transduced alveolar macrophages in tumour-
bearing mice, restricting IL-12 expression to the lung parenchyma and
promoting rejection of established lung metastases. IL-12 stimulated
IFNgamma production by innate lymphoid cells (ILC), inducing the
activation of interstitial macrophages, whose presence was essential for
tumour eradication. These data demonstrates the potent anti tumour
activity of local lentiviral IL-12 therapy against metastatic disease in
the lung and the critical role played by the innate crosstalk established
between ILCs and tissue resident phagocytes within the lung
microenvironment.

The work presented in this thesis combines two hugely promising nascent
technologies by establishing a CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing toolkit
for use in the immortalized erythroblast line BEL-A (Bristol Erythroid
Line -Adult). Various approaches to CRISPR-Cas9 editing were tested to
achieve knockouts, knock-ins, and transcriptional activation. An efficient
workflow for generation of lentiviral CRISPR-mediated knockouts was
established and multiple enucleation competent cell lines deficient in
individual blood groups were produced as tools for diagnostics and as
proof of principal for transfusion therapy. Multiple blood group knockouts
were combined to generate a cell line which could be differentiated to
form reticulocytes deficient in multiple antigens responsible for the most
common transfusion incompatibilities: ABO (H0), Rh (Rhnull), Kell (K0),
Duffy (Fynull) and GPB (S-s-U-). This represents a significant step
towards the generation of engineered red blood cells for transfusion of
patients with specific blood group matching requirements, such as those
with very rare blood types or those with diseases requiring regular
transfusion therapy. The genetic toolkit was expanded to demonstrate gene
regulation in the BEL-A cell line and efficient activation of erythroid
genes ICAM4 and SLC14A1 (Kidd) and non-erythroid genes CD4 and CD8A was
achieved using the CRISPR activator SunTag system. The genome editing
techniques established here provide valuable tools for the generation of
engineered red blood cells which holds great promise for basic research
purposes, for the future provision of a sustainable blood source for
transfusion, and as a platform for erythrocyte-based therapeutic
applications.

Parkinson's disease was first described more than 200 years ago and yet
the aetiology of the disease is not fully understood. Cellular phenotypes
include mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal clearance dysfunction with
alpha-synuclein accumulation and intracellular trafficking alterations. In
most cases PD develops sporadically and the causes are yet unknown. However,
in 10% of the cases, PD is inherited and the cause is genetic. Currently, 23
PARK loci have been identified within genes causing PD. Here, we focus on
PARK17, where a point mutation leading to an amino acid exchange p.D620N
in VPS35 has been found to cause an autosomal-dominant form of PD.

Fibroblasts from a patient carrying the p.D620N mutation and from two age
and gendermatched control were derived from a skin biopsy. Functional
analyses of these fibroblasts revealed that mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP) was decreased in the patient cells compared to controls
without any alteration of mitochondrial morphology. Next, the fibroblasts
were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), that were
characterised in detail. The iPSCs were first differentiated in small
molecule neuronal precursor cells (smNPCs), where we analysed
mitochondrial function and lysosomal clearance capacity. We found no
significant difference in MMP between patient and control smNPCs. However,
we observed a decreased autophagic flux and lower levels of mature
cathepsin D protein, a lysosomal hydrolase responsible for the degradation
of a-synuclein. Nonetheless, we found no difference in a-synuclein protein
level. In order to study the impact of p.D620N on PD-related neuronal
phenotypes we differentiated the smNPCs in this more disease-relevant cell
population. We generated a neuronal culture enriched in dopaminergic
neurons. We found that the mitochondrial network was fragmented with
smaller mitochondria and less branching. Mitochondria had lower MMP and
increased intra-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In
addition, mitochondrial respiration was impaired which resulted in lower
production of ATP. After CCCP treatment, mitophagy was induced in the
patient neurons to the same level as in the control neurons. However,
while in the control neurons the autophagosomes containing mitochondrial
fragments were successfully cleared, in the patient neurons they
accumulated and were not cleared properly. In line with this observation,
the autophagic flux was decreased and late endosome/lysosomal mass was
decreased. This decreased autophagic flux was accompanied by an increase
of alpha-synuclein protein levels.

We further wanted to pinpoint how p.D620N VPS35 caused mitochondrial
impairment in patient neurons. Accumulation of a-synuclein has been shown
to induce similar mitochondrial alterations. Therefore, we measured alpha-
synuclein protein levels in the mitochondrial and the cytosolic fraction
and found that it was increased in both fractions to the same ratio.
However, when we knocked down alpha-synuclein to the levels of the
controls, it was not sufficient to rescue the decreased MMP and increased
ROS level in the patient neurons. We conclude that alpha-synuclein
accumulation in the mitochondrial fraction was not sufficient to cause the
observed phenotype.

Recently, an increased LRRK2 kinase activity was identified in p.D620N
VPS35 mutant monocytes and erythrocytes from patients, as well as brains
from homozygous mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that pathological LRRK2
kinase activity may induce mitochondrial impairment. We measured the
phosphorylation levels of Rab10, one of LRRK2 kinase substrates, however,
no significant difference between patient and control neurons was observed.

In this study, we show for the first time that p.D620N VPS35 causes PD-
related cellular phenotypes in patient-derived neurons. The patient-
derived neurons displayed impaired mitochondria and lysosomal clearance,
with accumulation of alpha-synuclein.

The aim of this project was to characterize the newly established
pancreatic NET cell line NT-3 and to study its behavior in direct
comparison to the existing cell lines (QGP-1 and BON), upon treatment with
therapeutics and as a xenograft animal model. This is to evaluate if NT-3
provides a representative, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor model
for targeted and significant research on this tumor entity. Research on
new therapies for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) has been
hampered by the absence of a clinically relevant tumor model system. The
neuroendocrine identity of NT-3 was verified by the expression of multiple
NET-specific markers, which were highly expressed in NT-3 compared with
BON and QGP-1. As a sign of functional activity, we were able to detect
the expression and secretion of insulin in NT-3, corresponding to the
clinical insulinoma of the patient providing the tumor that NT-3 was
derived from. Until now, this well-differentiated phenotype is stable
since 58 passages. The proliferative labeling index Ki-67 of 14.6% +- 1.0%
in NT-3 is akin to the original tumor (15%-20%) and was lower than in BON
(80.6% +- 3.3%) and QGP-1 (82.6% +- 1.0%). Moreover, NT-3 showed high
expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs: 1, 2, 3, and 5), which are
targets of therapeutics successfully used in the treatment of pancreatic
NETs. In vivo growth was assessed in a xenograft mouse model. Upon
subcutaneous transplantation of NT-3 cells, recipient mice developed
tumors with an efficient tumor take rate (94%) and growth rate (139% +-
13%) by 4 weeks. Morphology and neuroendocrine marker expression of
xenograft tumors resembled the original human tumor. These outstanding
characteristics qualify NT-3 as a relevant model to study neuroendocrine
tumor biology and to develop new NET treatments.

My PhD is in the frame of the comparative oncology field about the genetic
study of mucosal melanoma (MM) in dogs, that spontaneously develop oral
melanoma, frequent in some breed and severe. Thus, it constitutes a good
natural model for human MM that is rare and very aggressive. The exome
sequencing analysis of 70 canine MM cases by the team allowed to identify
recurrent somatic alterations. I first focused on amplifications on canine
chromosome (CFA) 10 and 30. On a cohort of 73 cases, I showed that the
amplification of CFA 30 had a prognostic value. We showed that amplified
genes were also overexpressed and had a role on tumour cell proliferation.
The whole genome sequencing of canine cell lines showed that those
amplifications signedcomplex chromosomal rearrangements, as it is seen in
human MM. In the same time, the transcriptomic analysis of 32 canine MM
samples showed the existence of two molecular subgroups: the first
characterized by the overexpression of genes related to immune
microenvironment, and the second by overexpression of oncogenes like TERT
and MITF. Moreover, those groups differ in their structural variants
content, more important in the second one. Those results suggest the use
of different therapies, immunotherapy and targeted therapy respectively.
This work allowed to better characterize genetics of canine MM and opens
therapeutic perspectives to benefit human and veterinary oncology for non

Thermoregulation of the human body mainly relies on sweating. Thereby,
aqueous sweat fluid secreted by eccrine sweat glands onto the skin surface
evaporates and cools the skin. Although this is a natural, highly
efficient process providing humans with an evolutionary advantage,
appearance of wet patches on clothes is mostly undesired today. Especially
in case of sweat-related disorders such as hyperhidrosis, where excessive
sweating occurs, this poses a high burden for the individual. Underlying
dysregulation of sweating is, up to now, only partly understood and just
few alleviating agents are available. For some of them the mechanism of
action is well investigated, whereas the one of the most common
antiperspirant ingredient, aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH), is still only
partly disclosed. It is assumed to encompass physical blockage of the
eccrine sweat gland.

To intensify the knowledge of the sweating mechanism on a cellular level
and to elucidate possible physiological effects of ACH, a cell-based in
vitro test procedure was developed. As sweating is mainly a process of ion
fluxes between eccrine sweat gland cells, gland lumen, and surrounding
tissue, herein established methodical test system relies on monitoring of
intracellular changes of calcium, potassium, sodium, and chloride ions
using cultured primary human eccrine sweat gland cells. Employing this
novel procedure ACH was demonstrated to also evoke physiological reactions
in human eccrine sweat gland cells. Strikingly, a distinct class of
substances, Cl(-)-containing ammonium solutions, elicited the same
characteristic ion changes as ACH. With further testing, polyols were
identified as another class of substances dysregulating the ion
equilibrium in vitro. For both substance classes the antiperspirant effect
was verified in humans. Strengthening herein developed reliable in vitro
test system, even proposals for underlying cellular mode of action of
these agents are possible. This highlights the capabilities of these
methods and contributes significantly to understanding sweating on a
cellular basis.

Adding to the latter aspect, an organotypic three-dimensional model of the
human eccrine sweat gland was developed in this work to facilitate
detailed scrutiny of cell-cell-interactions between the cell types of
secretory coil and reabsorbing duct. In a further step, those cells were
successfully integrated into newly designed in vitro dermal equivalents
comparable to the natural environment in human skin. Both these in vitro
models emphasized cellular interdependency of coil and duct cells in
developing certain proteins and revealed some alterations in protein
expression of cultured cells compared to native eccrine sweat gland cells.

Those deviances were also apparent in herein generated eccrine sweat gland
duct cell line. After transduction with simian virus 40 large T antigen-
containing lentiviral vector and overcoming of a short proliferation
crisis, transduced eccrine duct cells exhibited an extended lifespan with
stable growth suggesting their immortalized state. As duct cells represent
the primary target of topically applied products and, so far, no
immortalized duct cell line is available for research, this newly
generated and described transduced duct cell line represents an important
tool for standardization of cellular material in future in vitro sweat
gland research. It should facilitate more detailed elucidation of
physiological sweating processes and pose a defined source of cellular
material for generation of organotypic sweat gland models.

Results of this PhD thesis add significantly to understanding the
mechanism of sweating including required cellular interactions. With the
help of newly generated eccrine sweat gland duct cell line standardization
of these in vitro approaches is feasibly in future, which allows for
further detailed investigation of perspiration and cellular
interdependency with relevance for treating dermal disorders.

Long-time science reporter Michael Gold describes in graphic detail how
the errant HeLa cells spread, contaminating and overwhelming other cell
cultures, sabotaging research projects, and eluding detection until they
had managed to infiltrate scientific laboratories worldwide. He tracks the
efforts of geneticist Walter Nelson-Rees to alert a sceptical scientific
community to the rampant HeLa contamination. And he reconstructs
Nelson-Rees's crusade to expose the embarrassing mistakes and bogus
conclusions of researchers who unknowingly abetted HeLa's spread.

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a
poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave
ancestors, yet her cells-taken without her knowledge-became one of the
most important tools in medicine. The first 'immortal' human cells grown
in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more
than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a
scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons-as much as a hundred
Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio
vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb's effects;
helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning,
and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet
Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the
'colored' ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white
laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta's small,
dying hometown of Clover, Virginia-a land of wooden slave quarters, faith
healings, and voodoo-to East Baltimore today, where her children and
grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.

Henrietta's family did not learn of her 'immortality' until more than
twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began
using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And
though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells
human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As
Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family-past
and present-is inextricably connected to the dark history of
experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the
legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.

Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in
the lives of the Lacks family-especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah, who
was devastated to learn about her mother's cells. She was consumed with
questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when
researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What
happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age
of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn't
her children afford health insurance?

Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The
Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of
scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.

Imagine being diagnosed with a disease as seemingly minor as melanoma that
quickly progresses to stage four cancer, where the chances of survival
drop to less than 10% in five years. And, the options are only surgery, a
handful of tough FDA-approved treatments, and a risky experimental therapy
hundreds of miles from home.

Usually we think of cancer as an ugly, terrifying disease. But Bob
Heffernan's amazing journey against all odds tells an uplifting story of
perseverance, hope, and positivity that will inspire all cancer patients.
He found that alongside fear and suffering, cancer provides numerous gifts
that nourish the human soul. It's a story about how we can find goodness
and beauty in even the most terrible challenge life throws at us: cancer.

When I heard the gut-wrenching words 'very rare cancer' and 'one in a
million' used to describe a type of cancer I had never heard of, it felt
as if all the breath had been sucked out of my lungs. I was immediately
launched into a place I'd never dreamed I would be. Like most people
dealing with life-threatening illness, the immediate, blood-draining fear
can be enormous, and the accompanying 'what-ifs' overwhelming. I gave The
Fear time to do its thing, and then used it to motivate me and push me
forward to do research, to gain knowledge, and to hopefully make
appropriate choices for the unwelcome challenges, obstacles, and burdens
that were directly in my path. I was determined not to let fear or
anything else consume me or stop me from taking my life back. Instead, I
chose to accept them as a necessary part of the long, painful journey I
faced.

Cancer caused me to look at life differently, to see the bigger picture;
to realize that life is often full of maze-like paths, filled with twists,
turns, and detours which can often complicate and change our lives in an
instant. I discovered that even when hurdles are harsh, when our plight
seems unbearable, when we are exhausted and think we can't endure much
more; we can consciously seize upon our hardships as opportunities for
self-examination and growth. They can become a time to reflect on and
appreciate the simple things which we have been blessed with. And it's
those positives that give us strength and can help us through whatever
challenges life presents. I realized we all have the ability to regain
control and fight to help ourselves through whatever lies ahead.
Confronting Chordoma Cancer focuses on the power of the human spirit and
hope.

The epic and controversial story of a major breakthrough in cell biology
that beat back German measles and other devastating diseases. Until the
late 1960s, tens of thousands of American children suffered crippling
birth defects if their mothers had been exposed to rubella, popularly
known as German measles, while pregnant; there was no vaccine and little
understanding of how the disease devastated fetuses. In June 1962, a young
biologist in Philadelphia, using tissue extracted from an aborted fetus
from Sweden, produced safe, clean cells that allowed the creation of
vaccines against rubella and other common childhood diseases. Two years
later, in the midst of a massive German measles epidemic, his colleague
developed the vaccine that would one day wipe out homegrown rubella. The
rubella vaccine and others made with those fetal cells have protected more
than 150 million people in the United States, the vast majority of them
preschoolers. The new cells and the method of making them also led to
vaccines that have protected billions of people around the world from
polio, rabies, chicken pox, measles, hepatitis A, shingles and adenovirus.

Meredith Wadman's masterful account recovers not only the science of this
urgent race, but also the political roadblocks that nearly stopped the
scientists. She describes the terrible dilemmas of pregnant women exposed
to German measles and recounts testing on infants, prisoners, orphans, and
the intellectually disabled, which was common in the era. These events
take place at the dawn of the battle over using human fetal tissue in
research, during the arrival of big commerce in campus labs, and as huge
changes take place in the laws and practices governing who 'owns' research
cells and the profits made from biological inventions. It is also the
story of yet one more unrecognized woman whose cells have been used to
save countless lives.

With another frightening virus imperiling pregnant women on the rise
today, no medical story could have more human drama, impact, or urgency
today than The Vaccine Race.

Since its inception in 1972, an increasing number of investi-gators have
utilized the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository as a source of
contaminant free, verified, biochemically mutant or chromosomally aberrant
cell cultures. This increased demand is illustrated on the following two
pages. A newly instituted utilization survey indicates that these cell
cultures are in demand in almost every discipline of biomedical research.
In 1979, the Repository has continued its efforts to assure the high
quality of cell cultures established and shipped: lymphoblast cell
cultures are being established from over 90% of the heparinized blood
specimens received, the collection is continually reviewed and cell
cultures are added or deleted as better cultures become available,
advanced equipment has been added for programmed freezing and liquid
nitrogen storage, and a new shipping container employed during the cold
winter months has guaranteed that over 94% of the cell cultures shipped
via air mail arrive in good condition. The sixth edition of the catalog
includes a number of changes which make it more informative and easier to
use. These changes include: a simplified table of contents, a section on
use of the catalog, a new format, a Repository number versus page number
index, a comprehensive list of references, and improvements to the
alphabetical diagnosis index. As submissions to the Repository approach
3,600 specimens it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify the
addition of an inadequately documented line to the collection. For this
reason, as much information as is available to support the clinical
diagnosis as well as a detailed pedigree should accompany the submission
of a specimen. This is especially important in the case of disorders with
unknown biochemical defects. Several collections have been judged complete
and, unless a specimen represents a unique opportunity i.e., blood and
skin from the same individual, a family unit, or a variant, the specimen
may not be banked. Improving the quality and characterization of the
existing collection will take precedence over expanding its size.

The seventh edition of the N.I.G.M.S. Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository
catalog contains a number of changes which make it more informative and
easier to use. These changes include double spacing between each listing
to increase legibility, highlighting the disease diagnosis by underlining,
and the replacement of brackets which contained family groups by two
columns of numbers which indicate the pedigree (Fam#) to which the
individual belongs and from which family member (Famm#) within the
pedigree the specimen was obtained. The bibliography (Appendix C) has been
enlarged to include approximately one thousand scientific publications
which either describe patients from whom specimens were obtained or cite
publications in which Repository cultures were utilized. During 1979, the
Repository has continued to be utilized by an increasing number of
investigators who desire a source of contaminant free, verified,
biochemically mutant or chromosomally aberrant cell cultures. This
increased demand is illustrated by the graphs on the following two pages.
The Repository has also continued its efforts to improve the quality of
the collection by having experts in various disease catagories either
verify the biochemical or chromosomal abnormalities present in the
cultures or review the clinical documentation for patients whose mutations
are not as yet verifiable in cultured cells. As the collection approaches
7,200 specimens, improving the quality and characterization of the
existing collection will take precedence over expanding its size. However,
the submission of specimens from well documented patients representing
disease catagories which are not currently stored in the Repository are
welcomed.

This edition of the catalog is dedicated to Dr. Arthur E. Green who
retired from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research on May 1, 1992
after 39 years of dedicated service. Since its inception in 1972, Dr.
Greene served as either the Director or Assistant Director of the National
Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Human Genetic Mutant Cell
Repository. Dr. Greene helped to develop many of the basic techniques of
culture which have become standard around the world. He coauthored more
than 170 publications covering a wide range of topics, including polio
virus cultivation, insect cell line cultivation and identification, and
the cryogenic storage of cell lines. His easy-going manner and his
encyclopedic knowledge of the collections will be greatly missed.

Nineteen ninety-two marked the twentieth anniversary of the NIGMS Human
Genetic Mutant Cell Repository. During the 1950's and 1960's, scientific
research had turned increasingly toward working with cultured cells.
However serious problems with interspecies and intraspecies contamination
and misidentification were discovered that invalidated research findings.
Dr. DeWitt Stetten, Director of the NIGMS, realized that the solution
would be to establish a national collection which would house well
documented, highly characterized, contamination-free cell cultures which
would be available to all qualified scientists. Following a national
competition, the Coriell Institute was awarded its first contract in 1972.
As science advanced, so have the services offered by the CCR. Somatic cell
hybrid mapping panels, regional mapping panels, extended family pedigrees
and cultures from vanishing populations are now part of collection. DNA is
also being provided for many of the cultures in the collection. The next
decade will probably witness additional changes in the scope of the NIGMS
Repository's activities.

Since 1972, the CCR have processed more than 13,000 submitted cell
cultures, solid tissue biopsies, and peripheral blood specimens and
provided more than 60,000 cell cultures and 2,500 DNA samples to
investigators. These activities have resulted in a worldwide reputation
for excellent, well characterized, thoroughly documented and contamination
free cell cultures and high quality DNA samples.

This edition of the catalog lists a total of 5,270 cell cultures and 275
DNA samples. The format of the catalog has been revised and three sections
have been added or updated: Specially Characterized Lymphoblast Cultures,
Extended Families - Lymphoblast Cultures, and Human Diversity Collection -
Lymphoblast Cultures. The first section contains cultures characterized by
HLA typing, the second contains cultures from the Amish, Utah, and
Venezuelan pedigrees as well as a listing of pedigrees found elsewhere in
the catalog that should prove useful for gene linkage studies, and the
third section lists cultures from a variety of diverse human populations
such as Amerindians, Melanesians, Pygmies, Japanese, Cambodians, and
Chinese. Many of the cultures found in this section are part of the Yale-
Stanford collection and are a representative sample of the larger
collection that is available from the contributor, Dr. Kenneth Kidd (Yale
University).

Appendix D, which presents the diagrammatic representation of
chromosomally aberrant cell cultures has been revised and updated for the
16th edition and a new series of diagrams showing the human chromosomes or
of human chromosomes present in the collection of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids has been added to the catalog section containing the to this
collection.

Investigators are encouraged to contact the Repository to submit specimens
from individuals with well documented genetic diseases or somatic cell
hybrids retaining human chromosomes not currently in the collection.

The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is one of the most important
destructive insect pests of cruciferous crops worldwide. Previous studies
identified both alpha-and betabaculoviruses that can infect and kill this
important lepidopteran pest. The genome of the alphabaculovirus isolate
Plutella xylostella nucleopolyhedrovirus-CL3 (PlxyNPV-CL3) was recently
sequenced and was found to be nearly identical (98.5%) to the genome of
Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV).
Interestingly PlxyNPV-CL3 is highly lethal for P. xylostella, whereas
AcMNPV is not. Therefore, any differences in the genome of these two
viruses may identify genes that are required for host adaptation. The
dominant difference between the PlxyNPV-CL3 and AcMNPV-C6 genome is the
open reading frame of the ie2 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of
the two IE2 proteins exhibit only 37.5% similarity. To determine if
PlxyNPV-CL3 IE2 is responsible for adaptation of AcMNPV to P. xylostella,
recombinant viruses were generated using bacmids. These viruses were an
ie2 knockout (vie2KO), and the ie2 knockout repaired with AcMNPV or
PlxyNPV-CL3 ie2 tagged with HA epitope (vie2KO-acie2HA and vie2KO-pxie2HA
respectively). Each of these viruses was tested for replication in various
cell lines which including Sf9, Tn5b1-4, and PxE-Po#583. Previous studies
have not analyzed the impact of a complete AcMNPV ie2 knockout.
Surprisingly, our results showed that deletion of ie2 led to a greater
than 90% reduction in budded virus (BV) production compared to wildtype
virus. In addition, occlusion body (OB) production was also greatly
reduced. Initial results with vie2KO-pxie2HA indicate that PlxyNPV-CL3 IE2
can rescue vie2KO producing BV titers nearly as high as AcMNPV IE2.
Further studies analyzing virus infection in P. xylotella larvae will be
reported.

Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a well-differentiated cancer that
encompasses 15-20% of all thyroid cancers and invasion is frequently seen
in the vascular structures within the thyroid gland and neck. FTC is
associated with up to 40% of all thyroid cancer related deaths with no
curative treatments beyond surgery and 131 Iodine. We report three new
authenticated FTC cell lines (SDAR1, SDAR2, SDAR3) from a patient
diagnosed with metastatic FTC to a lymph node and neck mass. A fourth FTC
cell line (THJ-306T) was derived from another FTC patient, all of which
had features of radioiodide insensitive tumors. Short tandem DNA repeat
(STR) analysis validated that the cell lines were derived from the patient
tumor tissues. Interestingly, the SDAR cell lines were not mutated for
retinoblastoma (Rb), KRas, HRas, PI3K, BRAFV600E or PAX8/PPARgamma.
However, the primary tumor cell line, SDAR1, was mutant for p53.
Expression of Pax8 and TSHR mRNA were present while PDS, DIO2, TPO and NIS
were absent. For the 4th FTC cell line, THJ-306T, contained Rb and NRas
codon 61 mutations and expressed TTF1 and Pax8 mRNA. With respect to
oncogenic signaling pathways, pERK and pAkt were elevated in all four cell
lines. Based upon these findings we tested and demonstrated antitumor
proliferative synergy using a MEK inhibitor (GSK-1120212) combined with an
Akt inhibitor (MK-2206). Using IC50 concentrations and fixed ratio drug
concentrations, CI values for combinatorial therapy were 0.071, 0.29, 0.24
and 0.29 respectively for SDAR1, SDAR2, SDAR3 and THJ-306T. Propidium
iodide measurement of cell death revealed synergy of the combinatorial
therapy. Thus, inhibiting these two oncogenic pathways in four new FTC
cell lines demonstrated strong antitumor synergy. We are currently
examining the role of RhoB which may play a role in the observed synergy.
Moreover, with the recent discovery that inhibition of the Akt pathway
leads to NIS re-expression and radioiodide uptake, we are exploring
whether these cells when exposed to combinatorial therapy respond to
iodine uptake and retention.

FTO (Fat mass and obesity-associated) has been identified as an obesity-
susceptibility gene, which is strongly associated with increased risk of
obesity. A recent study showed that the FTO gene product has a rapid
turnover in pancreatic beta cells and affects the regulation of insulin
secretion under glucose stimulation. However, the functional role and
molecular mechanisms of FTO in pancreatic beta cells is still unclear. In
this study, we aim to investigate the role of FTO in the pancreatic beta
cells using a new pancreatic beta cell line tool for beta cell function
called GRINCH cells (Glucose-Responsive Insulin-secreting C-peptide-
modified Human-proinsulin).

Embryonic cell lines constitute an experimental tool for in vitro studies
on animal development as well as on more basic cell processes. These cells
retain all developmental potentials, allowing the modification of gene
expression by a precise control of the environmental conditions. Here we
report the initial characterization of two monoclonal embryonic cell lines
from Sparus aurata, SAEC-C1 and SAEC-F1. Cells were obtained from 6 hours
post-fertilized eggs and cultured in L-15 media, 10% FBS, 15.0 mM NaCl at
22 Celsius. After passing 20 times, a limit dilution was carried out and
single cell-derived cell lines were selected. The capacity of cell lines
to form embryoid bodies was evaluated by cultivation in non-adherent
plastic dishes as well as the ability to be transfected using EGFP and
DsRed plasmids. Moreover, gene expression was analyzed by RTqPCR. Cell
lines actively grow as adherent monolayers, displaying small and round or
polygonal morphologies. After cryopreservation and thawing, they show a
viability over 83%. Dissociated cells formed clusters and spherical
structures indicative of embryoid bodies. Both cell lines were
successfully transfected, being the fluorescence detected at 48-72 hours
after transfection. The expression of genes associated with stress (hsp70,
sod2, cat, gpx4), fatty acids metabolism, (fas, lpl, scd1a and delta6fad)
immune innate response (saBD, hep, lyz, ppar?, lox, cox2) and apoptosis
(Bcl2, Bax) was detected in both lines. Our results confirm that these
monoclonal embryonic cell lines could represent an important tool to
enlarge our knowledge on cellular processes as well as to perform in vitro
studies on genetic manipulation in sea bream.

COLO 508 with the exception of numerous neurosecretory-like granules in
COLO 338. Biochemical characterization of the lines included assay of
peptide hormones, carcinoembryonic antigen secretion, estrogen,
progesterone, glucorcorticoid and androgen receptor proteins, and of
allozyme profiles. Cytogenetic analysis of COLO 508 revealed a bimodal
karyotype (55,58) and marker chromosomes including a ring chromosome and a

Circadian rhythms exist in many biochemical, physiological and cellular
processes, including hormonal synthesis and/or secretion. These rhythms
are driven by endogenous clocks that are ultimately entrained by
environmental factors, being the light-dark cycle (LD) the most important
synchronizer. Fish circadian rhythms appear sustained by cellautonomous
mechanisms, but unfortunately, fish cellular clocks have been poorly
studied in marine species. An important bottleneck in fish research is the
supply and maintenance of embryos, larvae, juvenile and adult specimens.
In this context, cell lines constitute powerful and alternative tools with
important applications in fish chronobiology and endocrinology. In this
study, we have used a recently developed monoclonal embryonic cell line
derived from the blastula stage of gilthead seabream embryos (SAEC-H7) to
analyse the oscillation of central clock components and the response to
different photoregimes. Our results showed rhythmic expression of key
clock genes in embryonic cells, which were able to re-entrain to a light
cycle inversion. Rhythmic expression of some core clock genes persisted
under constant light and dark conditions after several days, but with
decreased mesors and amplitudes, reinforcing the circadian and endogenous
nature of the cellular rhythms. These results indicate that SAEC-H7
contain a functional molecular clock entrained by light, representing an
important tool for chronobiological and endocrinological studies in fish.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a neoplasm derived from the C-cell, an
intrathyroidal cell of neural crest origin. In addition to secreting the
calcium-regulating polypeptide (CT), this tumor reportedly also secretes
histamine, prostaglandins and carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in humans. A
number of in vitro models, including tissue slices, organ culture explants
and mixed monolayers of C-cells and other cell types in primary cultures
have been used to study the factors regulating the functions of normal and
neoplastic C-cells. Experimental studies on the available models of trout
and rodent C-cell cultures and transplantable rodent tumors are highly
useful in providing us with a better understanding of calcitonin secretion
and regulation as well as C-cell function. A wide spectrum of preserved
biological and biochemical markers, hormonal responsiveness and secretory
responses to several substances contribute significantly to their
attractiveness as animal model systems. However, the limitations of these
systems are rooted in restrictions imposed by difficulties in direct
translation of data obtained in an animal model system into the language
of human disease. None of the reported cell lines derived from human
thyroid medullary carcinoma have gained wide acceptance as fully suitable
human models since they were either short term cultures or lost the
characteristic marker, calcitonin, after being in culture for several
months. This paper describes a new cell line which we have established in
vitro from a specimen obtained by needle biopsy of a patient-with thyroid
medullary carcinoma. This cell line which we designated 'TT' has been
continuously cultivated in vitro since 1978. In culture these cells secret
high levels of calcitonin and embryonic antigen. When injected into the
nude mice, they produce rapidly growing tumors. Thus, this cell line may
be useful as a model for biochemical and physiological studies on human
medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as human calcitonin secretion and its
regulation.

Antiviral vaccines are essential for preventing epidemic disease; however,
the production of these therapeutics is often limited by low-yielding
manufacturing processes. Similarly, the development of gene therapies is
constrained during the large-scale production of viral vectors, such as
adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery platforms for gene transfer. To
speed the pace of these various areas of bioproduction, ATCC addressed the
need for efficient viral replication by optimizing three cell lines
commonly used in virus manufacturing. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-
editing technology to develop STAT1 and BAX knockout cell lines capable of
producing high-titer viral stocks. These newly created cell lines can
produce model clinical viruses and adeno-associated viruses at titers much
higher than the parental cell lines, providing an efficient method for
biopharmaceutical companies to increase production while reducing
associated costs.

This experiment was designed to investigate whether weightlessness induces
changes at the ultrastructural level of mammalian cells. It has been shown
that most, if not all, cells are morphologically arranged in an orderly
fashion with regard to the respective location of the cytoplasmic
organelles, the nucleus in relation to the cytoplasmic organelles, and the
intranuclear organelles with respect to each other. However, it is thought
that the protoplasmic flow within every living cell, as well as the
cellular skeleton, may obscure the visible effects of gravity in such an
organisa-tion. This would imply that the effects of weightlessness might
only result in minute changes in the ultrastructural distribution of
cellular components. A search for such changes using stereological methods
was carried out with highly polarised suspended cells. Changes in
ultrastructure were correlated with changes in cell metabolism by means of
auto-radiography. Specific statistical and stereological methods of
analysis as well as specific staining techniques had therefore to be
employed to allow a thorough analysis and to determine the three-
dimensional construction of the cells.

Mammalian cellular differentiation is an irreversible, multistaged process
by which the numerous types of highly specialized adult cells are formed
from totipotent cells of the very early embryo. The study of this process
is one aspect of research efforts in many disciplines to detect factors
that influence differentiation or cause abnormal mammalian development.
Neoplasia may be one abnormality resulting from a derangement or
interference in the differentiation sequence. The mouse teratocarcinoma
system is a model for studies of development and of neoplasia (Pierce 1967;
Stevens 1967). The teratocarcinoma stem (embryonal carcinoma [EC]) cells
are primitive, pluripotent cells that are the malignant component of the
tumor but also are capable of differentiating into benign somatic tissues
representing derivatives of all three germ layers (reviewed by Graham 1977;
Solter and Damjanov 1979; Martin 1980). Thus, these EC cells are valuable
for research in embryogenesis and on the relation between neoplasia and
differentiation. Human nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors consist
of one or more components of embryonic (EC, teratocarcinoma, teratoma) or
extraembryonic (choriocarcinoma, yolk sac carcinoma) tissues and, in
specimens of teratocarcinoma and teratoma, of various somatic tissues
with characteristics of benign cells (Mostofi 1977; Nochomovitz et al.
1977). Thus, these tumors have many features in common with the mouse
teratocarcinomas. One objective of our research is to establish cell lines
representing different types of testicular germ cell tumors to examine
the relations between these tumor cells and their potential value in
studies of cellular differentiation and neoplasia. This presentation
describes the results of our studies with two human EC cell lines and
their differentiation potential in vitro.

The work of culturing hemocytes from larvae of Mythimna separata Walker was
published in 1980. By using culture medium BML-TC 10 supplemented with
calf serum and Hepes, cells can be transferred successfully and thus a new
cell line is established. Up to now it has been transferred more than 100
passages, Four cell types - plasmatocyte, prohemocyte, granulocyte and
spherulocyte are found in our culture, within which plasmatocyte seems to
be the most prominent cell type, and the leaf-like and vermiform
plasmatocytes are all found. The cells are mainly suspended in culture,
only a few cells occasionary attach to bottle loosely. But when the cells
in 16th passage are recovered from liquid nitrogen and cultured in BML-TC-10
medium, whether Hepes is added or not, the cells attach to bottle
firmly, many of which arc spindle in shape; and at the beginning of this
recovery experiment, if the medium BML-TC 10 is supplemented with
yeastolate, the cells become suspending just the same as original culture.
But later, although yeastolate is added, the cells still remain the
attached type. Hepes, as an buffer agent, has been reported to have the
ability to support the long-term division potential in tissue culture
system. But recently, authors notice that it is injurious to cells and
suggest it be used carefully in tissue culture. In our culture the cell
line has been established after the using of Hepes, no side-effect has
been observed obviously until now, whether there is any ill effect of
Hepes upon the cells will be studied further. The work of establishment of
cell line from hemocytes of Mythimna separata was not known before, it is

We were able to establish a cell line from a skin tumour of a case of
bovine skin leukosis and to detect a formerly unknown bovine retrovirus,
that showed no antigenic and genetic relationship with BLV. Although the
SBL-H-12578 particles appear to be associated with some cases of SBL there
is no conclusive evidence that the virus is the causative agent of the
tumours. Attempts to prepare labeled cDNA from SBL-H-12578 RNA have so far
failed due to the poor virus production of the cells. Hybridization
experiments with DNA from tumour material of sporadic cases and normal
tissues have not yet been performed. Therefore the main question as to
whether the particles are of exogenous or endogenous origin remains
unanswered.

We have analyzed the DNA polymerase activities in cultured cells and
embryos of Ceratitis capitata Wied. and we have observed that the three
eukaryotic polymerases-alpha, -beta and - gamma were detectable in crude
extracts. However the activity responding to polymerase-beta did not
correspond to a true DNA polymerase-beta upon subsequent sedimentation and
purification procedures. Our studies with aphidicolin, the specific
inhibitor of polymerase-alpha, indicate that cultured Med-fly cells show
an arrest in cellular growth at much higher concentration of the drug than
that observed for other eukaryotic cells. This is reflected also by a
decreased sensitivity to aphidicolin of DNA polymerase-alpha purified from
Med-fly embryos.

Rat liver epithelial cell lines are well suited for studies of
carcinogenicity mechanisms and carcinogen/mutagen screening because of
their relevance to epithelial-cell-derived human carcinomas and liver-
related carcinogen metabolism. Yet, with the exception of numerous reports
of malignant transformation by various chemical carcinogens, few
laboratories are making use of such systems, possibly because in vitro
transformation markers that have been successfully applied to
mesenchymally derived cells in culture often do not reliably identify
transformed epithelial cell colonies. Simple, clearly defined markers are
essential, for example, in the screening of drugs or environmental
contaminants for carcinogen potential, not only for toxicity testing, but
also for determining the malignancy status of target cells in vitro and
for monitoring the malignant transformation of target organs following in
vivo chemical exposure. One such marker, the loss of calcium requirement
for proliferation in vitro with malignancy, has been well established for
both mesenchymal and epithelial cells (hereafter referred to as the "low
calcium transformation marker") and has been proposed in various surveys
of transformation markers for epithelial cells as a reliable indicator of
malignancy. It has been extensively applied to rat liver epithelial cell
studies, leading to important observations on the role of calcium in the
initiation of DNA synthesis. In this laboratory, we have used a rat liver
cell model to study this marker and others in the testing for cancer-
causing agents. The application of the low calcium transformation marker
has also led to further studies in growth controls of normal vs. tumor
liver cells, as well as to possible in vitro tests for diagnosis of
malignancy in vivo.

deciduous tree species in the Northeast United States and Canada. We have
recently found the previously identified nucleopolyhedrovirus OpbrNPV in
O.brumata in Massachusetts and, as an initial step in developing this virus
for the control of winter moth, we have established a cell line from this
insect. Embryonated winter moth eggs were dissected, and pieces of embryo
were transferred to TNM-FH and ExCell420 media supplemented with fetal
bovine serum to establish primary cell cultures. Cultures were incubated
at 19 Celsius and sub-cultured using trypsin to produce an embryonic cell
line, designated IIBBL-ObE1. The initial infection of this cell line was
accomplished at passage 15 using occlusion-derived virus, and appearance
of occlusion bodies (OBs) inside the nuclei of infected cells occurred
with one week post infection. OBs recovered from infected cells were
confirmed to be OpbrNPV by PCR and were infectious when fed to winter moth
larvae.

Nutritional requirements of insect cells cultured in vitro have attracted
the attention of many investigators in this field for a long time. During
the last decade many continuous cell lines were obtained. Among them were
some cell lines which had been considered very difficult to culture, if
not impossible. Success of obtaining such cell lines seems most likely to
be due to the improvement of culture media. In other words, the
modification of the culture media satisfied nutritional requirements of
the cells for multiplication. There are still many insect species from
which cell lines cannot be obtained. In order to develop culture media
which can support the cell growth of such insects, information on the
nutritional requirements of the cells will give a clue.

Unfortunately, nutritional requirements of the cultured insect cells have
not been studied extensively, and the available information is limited. In
this article, the author has tried to summarize the information on
nutritional requirements of insect cells hitherto obtained.

Mosquitoes are a problem in temperate and tropical zones of the world. The
adult female requires vertebrate blood for her eggs to develop and seeks a
host soon after emergence. During the blood meal, a variety of human and
animal pathogens may be exchanged between host and mosquito, including
viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and filarial worms. Unfortunately, the
relationship between vector and pathogen is in most cases poorly
understood because of a lack of suitable in vitro culture systems. We use
mosquito cells to study the metabolic characteristics of these
invertebrates at the cellular level and their relationship with
mosquitoborne protozoan parasites. We are working mainly with two cell
lines: one, ASE-IV, isolated by us from a vector of malaria, Anopheles

Several continuous cell lines have been developed at the Forest Pest
Management Institute (FPMI) from the tissues of major forest insect pests
to facilitate the in vitro investigations of insect pathogens. These cell
lines originated from the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), the
forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the red-headed pine sawfly
(Neodiprion lecontei), and the white-marked tussock moth (Orgyia
leucostigma). Isozyme analyses were performed to confirm the identity of
the new cell lines. Results of these analyses are presented here.

In the silkworm, Bombyx mori, three cell lines (S.P.C.Bm36, BM-N, and
SES-BoMo-15A) have been established. These cell lines were already
characterized, but genetic and physiologic data are rare. Furthermore, one
of them, S.P.C.Bm36(Bm36) cell line in the currently available form, is not
B. mori type. The original cell source of the BM-N(Bm) has not been
determined. Thus, we tried to establish and characterize new cell lines of
B. mori. An appropriate method to characterize the genome of the new cell
lines and the previously established cell lines is blot hybridization with
the gene probes proper to B. mori. It is a useful method for biochemical
analysis.

Recently, continuous cell lines of insects increased in number by
improvement of culture media and procedures. According to Hink, it reached
more than 130 from more than 60 species of invertebrates. In the family of
Tortricidae, eight continuous cell lines from three species have been
established by Hink and Ellis, Sohi, Mahr and Miltenburger (unpublished),
and Peter (unpublished). Eight new cell lines from six species have been
added to the list. These six species are Adoxophyes orana fasciata,
Adoxophyes sp., Pandemis heparana, Archippus breviplicanus, Hoshinoa
longicellana. and Homona magnanima. They are serious pests for fruit
growing and tea cultivation in Japan. With some of them, microbiological
control using insect viruses has been demonstrated; however, the
fundamental properties of these viruses are not so clear for want of
established cell lines that are capable of replicating these viruses. In
this paper, the method used for establishing several characteristics of
eight new continuous cell lines including susceptibility to insect
pathogenic viruses are described.

Since the first successful establishment of Drosophila cell lines by
Echalier and Ohanessian (1969) and Kakpakov et al. (1969), a large number
of permanent Drosophila cell lines have been established by several groups
but the collection of available cell lines is of limited genetic diversity
(Schneider and Blumenthal 1978). We have established a set of 14 different
cell lines that are derived from 10 well defined mutant Drosophila stocks.
The mutants were selected with respect to cytologically recognizable
marker chromosomes, allozyme variants, enzyme deficiencies, and
conditional lethality. The mutant cell lines were demonstrated to express
the respective mutant phenotypes at the cellular level and under in vitro
conditions. Cell lines carrying genetic markers and conditional lethal
mutations will prove useful for the isolation and identification of hybrid
Drosophila cells following somatic cell fusion (Bernhard 1976). The
conditional lethal cell lines will allow the study of in vitro mutagenesis
by determining the reversion frequency of defined mutations under
restrictive con-ditions. They provide further a critical and sensitive
assay system to study possible transformation in eucaryotic cells by means
of cloned gene sequences that might become available in the near future
(Gehring 1978).

malignancies of the larval hematopoietic system. The mutant larvae are
characterized by extremely enlarged, hematopoietic organs and an enormous
increase of free blood cells in the hemolymph. The increased numbers of
free blood cells in the mutant larvae facilitated the establishment of

Some evidence exists that the response of bone to microgravity is
osteoblast mediated. In order to test this hypothesis we have made a
comparative study in space and on earth of the acquisition of early
osteoblastic phenotype markers (ALP and Collagen type I) in a pre-
osteoblastoid cell line MN7 mounted on a collagen matrix. In addition, the
response of MN7 cells to two potent bone effectors. 11-1 (1 ng/ml) and FTH
(10-7 M), was studied under micro- and unit gravity. The results show
that although the proliferation of the MN7 cells is not affected by
microgravity, differentiation as measured by the expression of ALP and
collagep type I, is slowed down In contrast. interleukin-1 and PTH seem
to elicit a larger response in space than on earth. These results may
indicate that microgravity alters bone metabolism in space by a dual mode
of action: (i) suppressed differentiation of pre-osteoblasts towards
mature osteoblasts and (ii) an exaggerated response to bone resorption
inducing effector molecules in osteoblasts.

Expression of alpha1E (E class) subunits in Xenopus oocytes or in
mammalian cell lines produces calcium channels that show rapid
inactivation. It was originally proposed that alpha1E was the alpha
subunit for low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium channels. Under identical
recording conditions, we compared biophysical and pharmacological
properties of alpha1E expressed in HEK293 cells with alpha1B (B class)
expressed in the same cell line and LVA calcium channel currents in a rat
pituitary cell line (GH3). Alpha1E calcium channels showed biophysical
properties that were similar to those of alpha1B channels, activation
voltages that were depolarised relative to GH3 T-type current and potent
block by Cd2+ and the non-selective calcium channel toxin omega-Aga-IIIA.
These features of alpha1E calcium channels are similar to those of R-type
calcium channels described in cerebellar granule neurons, and not to GH3
T-type or other LVA calcium channels.

The 40 Kd tax (p40X or tat) protein from HTLV-I, known to exhibit
transcriptional transactivation activity has been cloned and expressed in
E. coli as a trpE fusion protein. This recombinant protein was purified to
homogeneity and used as an immunogen to develop several monoclonal
antibodies (MABs) to tax, of the IgM and IgG2a isotypes. Spleen cells from
immunized Balb/c mice were fused with P3X63Ag8 myeloma cells, screened on
an ELISA assay to the recombinant protein, cloned by limiting dilution and
ascites prepared and purified by HPLC. Selected MAbs were further
characterized by several methods including Western blot,
radioimmunoprecipitation, competition ELISA assay and Geysen epitope
mapping. All of the MAbs recognize the recombinant tax protein and several
of the MAbs also recognize the native tax from a lysate of an HTLV-I
transformed cell line, SLB-1. This binding to native tax can be competed
by the recombinant protein. Competition ELISA assays with patient sera,
known to contain antibody to the tax protein, reveal that the MAbs and
some patient sera may recognize similar epitopes on the protein. In an
attempt to localize binding sites on tax, mapping by Geysen technology has
revealed a few potential epitopes for selected MAbs. Work is in progress
to complete this mapping and determine if these sites are relevant binding
sites for tax reactive antibodies in patient sera. In conclusion, anti-tax
MAbs have been developed which are useful both for the detection and
quantitation of native and recombinant tax. These MAbs are also being used
to localize binding sites on the tax protein.

Two epithelial cell lines (McA-RH8994 and McA-RH7777) derived from Morris
hepatomas 8994 and 7777 have been established in culture. Both lines,
like the parent tumors, produce alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The peak of AFP
secretion into culture medium occurs during the logarithmic phase of the
growth curve. Both lines are capable of growth in serum-free medium
although at a reduced rate when compared to serum-containing medium. In
serum-free medium, addition of dexamethasone (DEX) reduces cell
multiplication and increases AFP production in McA-RH8994 whereas DEX
accelerates cell multiplication and decreases AFP production in McA-RH7777.
McA-RH7777 produces AFP and albumin (Alb) at 600:1. McA-R118994 begins to
secrete alpha-M-fetoprotein (AMFP) either after addition of
glucocorticoids or at the end of the log phase of growth. The availability
of these cell lines, both producing "transitory cell antigens" as defined
by Uriel but having different responses to DEX, provides additional tools

The malignant potential of neoplastic or transformed cells correlates with
their ability to multiply to a high saturation density in vitro. This
property has been demonstrated in a number of syngeneic mouse and hamster
cell-host systems. In human work, tests for tumorigenicity must
necessarily be indirect, since autologous and allogeneic transplantation
experiments are precluded by ethical considerations. The ability of a
given population of human cells to grow as a solid hetero-transplant in
immunologically privileged sites or immuno-deprived hosts of rodent origin
seems to reflect their malignant potential. With the definition of a
marked deficiency of thymus-dependent immune function in the congenitally
athymic nude mice, this model has been widely used for
heterotransplantation and chemotherapy studies of human tumors. A number
of human tumor biopsies and cultured cells including malignant melanoma
have been successfully transplanted to nude mice. Some attempts have been
made to correlate heterotransplantability of virally transformed human
fibroblastic cells or human cell lines of both neoplastic and non-
neoplastic origin, with their in vitro growth characteristics. To our
knowledge, however, no quantitative studies by a more analytical approach
have been reported to confirm such correlation in human tumor cells.

We have recently investigated seven well-characterized human melanoma cell
lines in terms of their transplantability in the cheek pouch of the
cortisonized hamster and have found no correlation between
heterotransplantability and saturation density, although progressive in
vivo growth was noted only among the melanoma lines which were grossly
pigmented. Within heterogeneous cell populations, there may be variable
expression of a common genotype depending on the relative influence of the
prevalent selective pressures. Thus, in an uncloned population the ability
to grow as a xenograft may be predominantly manifest by certain
subpopulations while the in vitro growth potential may be more dependent
on different subpopulations. Therefore, in the present study we used

Bone loss resulting from long-duration space flight is a well known
medical risk for space travellers, as a weakened skeleton is more
susceptible to bone fractures. In addition to weightlessness the astronaut
is also exposed to cosmic ionizing radiation. In order to elucidate
changes in bone cell metabolism by ionizing radiation, a ground-based bone
cell model has been developed. This model consists of a bunch of
immortalized murine osteocyte, osteoblast and pre-osteoblast cell lines
representing discrete stages of differentiation: The osteocyte cell line
MLO-Y4 (obtained from L. Bonewald, Kansas City, USA), the osteoblast cell
line OCT-1 (obtained from D. Chen, San Antonio, USA), and the subclones 4
and 24 of the osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 (obtained from ATCC, Manassas,
Virginia, USA). Regarding their growth properties, MLO-Y4 cells show the
highest growth velocity with a doubling time of 15.8 h. The osteoblast
cell line OCT-1 has a doubling time of 27.3 h. The respective values for
MC3T3-E1 subclone 24 and S4 are 90.5 h and 51.6 h. To investigate the
stage of differentiation, the expression of alkaline phosphatase, of
osteocalcin and of E11 was examined. Survival after X-ray exposure was
determined using the colony forming ability test. The resulting dose-
effect relationships revealed significant differences. The parameter D0 of
the survival curves ranges between 1.8 Gy for OCT-1, 1.9 Gy for MLO-Y4,
2.0 Gy for subclone 24 and 2.3 Gy for subclone 4. The quantitative
acquisition of DNA-strand breaks was performed by Fluorescent Analysis of
DNA-Unwinding (FADU). The results can be correlated with the corresponding
survival curve. In conclusion, the cell lines with higher differentiation
levels are less sensitive to radiation when compared to the lower
differentiated osteoblast cell lines.

A continuous cell line designated as BPMNU-MyCo-1 has been derived from
the fat body of maize armyworm, Mythimna convecta. Primary cultures were
initiated in MGM-448 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 3% Bombyx mori
serum and subsequently adapted to MM medium with 3% FBS. The cell
population consisted predominantly of small and large round suspended
cells with few spindle shaped ones. The karyotype was typical of
lepidopterans consisting of 80-100 microchromosomes. Cells could grow at a
wide range of temperatures from 20-30 C in MGM-448 medium, however, they
were sensitive to changes in pH of the medium. The population doubling
time of the cell line was 40 hrs at 25 C, and it could be stored at 4 C
for five months. The cell line was inoculated with Nosema locustae spores
and infection appeared three days postinoculation. By the seventh day some
cells were filled with spores. At 15 days postinoculation 32% of the cells
were infected with spores with a total yield ranging from 2.2x10^6 to
4.0x10^6 /ml. Infected cells were subcultured and by the fourth passage
spore production decreased. The harvested spores were infectious to
Locusta migratoria.

We previously have established several inner ear cell lines from a two-
week old transgenic mouse (Immortomouse) harboring the thermolabile
immortalizing gene tsA58. These cell lines are capable of rapid
proliferation when cultured at 33 C in the presence of interferon-gamma
(IFN) and have the potential to differentiate when cultured at 39 C in the
absence of IFN (non-permissive condition). When cultured in the DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), these cell lines
are able to express the inner ear specific protein OCP-2 but they neither
fully differentiate nor exhibit the structural characteristics of the
cells from which they are derived. For the present study, we selected two
of these cell lines, SVK-1 and SVK-2, which were derived from the stria
vascularis. We cultured them in the presence of the growth factors TGF-
alpha, IGF1, EGF, FGF2, BDNF, NT3, which were applied individually or in
combination in order to determine whether they could induce the
differentiation process. Cultures were monitored by phase contrast light
microscopy and by immunofluorescence using antibodies against Nestin, a
marker for neuroepithelial stem-like cells and against occludin, a tight
junction protein used as a marker for differentiated epithelial cells. The
cells initially were allowed to divide at the permissive condition (33 C +
IFN) and then were maintained in a medium with 5% FBS without IFN for one
week prior to culturing at 39 C. At the permissive condition the cells
were pleomorphic and expressed nestin, but during the first week at the
non-permissive condition they began to show contact inhibition, great
reduction in nestin expression, and exhibited an epithelial-like shape.
Addition of growth factors stimulated the cells to further differentiate.
EGF (100 ng/ml) was the most effective factor for the SVK-1, while the
combination of TGF-alpha (100 ng/ml) and IGF1 (100 ng/ml) was the most
effective for the SVK-2. Under these conditions both cell lines formed
tight junctions and organized into a regular polygonal epithelial
monolayer that resembled the marginal or basal cells of the stria
vascularis. Thus, these new cell lines probably represent true stria
vascularis epithelial cells, and maybe useful for future studies of stria
vascularis function.

The cell lines E7 and G9B4 were obtained after cloning of the permanent
cell line LSCC-SF-Mc29, established from a transplantable chicken hepatoma
induced by the myelocytomatosis virus Mc29. It was found that these cells
differ from each other in morphology, karyotype, in vitro and in vivo
growth properties. The results obtained revealed some causal relationship
between alterations in chromosomal number, on one hand, and the
tumorigenicity of the cells on the other. The correlation was - the higher
percentage of the threeploidy, the lower tumorigenicity of the cells. Our
data suggest that these cell lines could be considered as a model for
tumor heterogeneity investigations and could be useful in the attempts to
get a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in (virus-induced)
cancerogenesis.

during initial operation without prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Cells
from tumor mass were grown in culture as monolayers with the separate use
of RPMI-1640 containing fetal cord serum. The growth curve of cell line
was measured comparably. The cell line has been maintained for one year,
and passaged over 80 times. The histologic pattern of tissue culture cell
line was indistinguishable from that of original ovarian carcinoma.
Heterotransplantation of tumor mass. Ultrastructural analysis of tumor
cell showed specific morphological feature and receptor study showed
negative for both estrogen and progesteron receptor. They also showed
human chromosome pattern, and showed specific ectopic hormone production.
This new cell line will be of utility in investigations of tumor specific
antigens, ectopic hormone production, immunotherapy, inununodiagnosis
and sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents.

An improved understanding of the feline retroviruses, FeLV and RD-114, and
endogenous sarc genes in relation to FOCMA and neoplastic transformation
depends mainly upon the availability of well characterized feline cell
cultures. Over the past decade we have attempted to establish tumor cell
lines from numerous spontaneous tumors of domestic house cats.
Contamination with foamy and other indigenous viruses destroyed many of
these cultures but we were successful in deriving several long-term
epithelial tumor cell lines and many embryo fibroblastic cell cultures of
both long and short duration. These cultures were treated extensively with
chemicals and/or infected with heterolo-gous retroviruses in an effort to
transform them, to induce endogenous viruses or to rescue endogenous sarc
genes. Of special interest was one embryo cell culture (CF-927) that has
been maintained in our laboratory for over nine years. This culture
underwent spontaneous transformation at late subpassage but transformed
sooner if treated with a chemical carcinogen or infected with FeLV,
subgroup C. In this paper we describe this particular embryo culture and
summarize major findings concerning expression of retrovirus, FOCMA and
endogenous sarc genes in the cultured cat cells.

In this paper, we describe some characteristics of two ovine and one
porcine thyroid cell strains. The porcine cells grow in monolayer in 6H
plus 0.1 % C.S. enriched synthetic medium. The ovine cells are grown
routinely in either 6H or 5H (without TSH) media containing 0.1 % C.S. The
three cell strains are two year-old. All are sensitive to insulin,
thyrotropin and hydrocortisone. The other three "hormones" do not modify
growth. However the combination of somatostatin and glycyl-histidyl-lysine
is slightly inhibitory for growth. In contrast with the FRTL line, the 5H
ovine cells are not TSH-dependent for growth. Furthermore, the 6H cells
grow in absence of serum, synthesize thyroglobulin at high level even in
the last passages tested and formed follicles during one year and a half
despite subculturing. The cell strains were named PORTHOS (Porcine Thyroid
"0" Serum) and OVNIS (Ovine "Nihil" Serum) and represent new tools in
thyroid cell studies.

Although a great deal is known about the ultrastructure of both normal and
neoplastic cells of neuroectodermal origin, our appreciation of the three-
dimensional architecture and relationships of various neurons and glial
cells rests largely on classic light microscopic studies employing silver
impregnations of Golgi and Cajal. Ultrastructural serial sectioning
techniques have also been combined with computer assisted reconstruction
methods to further extend some of these relationships, e.g., synaptic
contacts of a neuron in well-defined anatomical systems. An alternate
complementary approach to three-dimensional architecture and relationships
of cells in the nervous system should also be possible utilizing
techniques of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, in order to
visualize cells with this technique, cells must either be isolated or
fractured in situ for examination. Isolation of cells from the central
nervous system (CNS) may significantly truncate or distort the processes
of cells as well as result in artefactual changes in their surfaces.
Cleavage of CNS tissue along natural fracture planes, as freeze fracture,
also gives only a limited plane of view in which many processes of a cell
are incompletely visualized, and in SEM the interpretation of surfaces
cleaved after critical point drying, and the various artefacts created by
such methods, are not well established and thus preclude definitive
interpretation.

Tissue culture would seem to present a more ideal starting point for
surface studies and visualization of relationships between different cells.
Growth patterns of various neuroectodermal elements can be studied after
there is repair of the initial damage incurred during cellular isolation.
The temporal development, or morphological changes in particular cells in
the living state, may be followed by light microscopy and then selected
for SEM evaluation. Finally, in isolated defined tissue culture systems
such as those of organotypic culture or monolayer culture, selected cells
may be exposed to agents or isotopes under controlled experimental
conditions for further evaluation of given morphological states. Tissue
culture, however, represents only one starting point since the most
exquisite anatomical definitions are lost, and only selected special
cellular elements are capable of growth and maintenance in such systems, i.
e., embryonic and fetal CNS, and tumor cells. The purpose of this chapter
is to describe similarities and differences clarified by SEM in identified
developing neurons and glial cells in culture with their "transformed"
counterparts, neuronal and glial neoplasms in culture.

The morphogenetic processes leading to the formation of thyroid follicles
in vitro have been intensely studied in a variety of cell culture systems
such as in monolayer and in collagen cultures. Two basic mechanisms of
follicle morphogenesis have been described: One involves the fusion of
originally intracellular lumina, while the other postulates the pro-
gressive enlargement of primarily intercellular spaces. Most studies were
performed on primary cultures of thyroid cells during early in vitro
passages, since follicular cells in vitro display only a limited growth
potential and rapidly dedifferentiate. Only a few cell lines have been
reported to retain the ability to form follicle-like structures during
long term in vitro culture (e.g. FRTL (but not FRTL-5), OVNIS, PORTHOS).
We here describe a continuous cell line (called PETCAT 1) prepared from
autonomously growing multinodular, hyperthyroid feline goiters, which had
a morphogenetic potential not observed in 4 other cell lines. In PETCAT
cells, the follicle forming process began within the single cell before
the first cell division. The follicle forming potential was very different
from one cell to the next. In addition, fully functional follicles were
observed after in vivo growth of a FRTL-5 mutant in nude mice.

In addition to this, these MAbs make the identification and isolation of
anti-viral or anti-bacterial antibodies of a given class possible. The
purification of human antibodies or Ig can also be resolved by using the
immunoaffinity chromatography with these rat MAbs.

In this chapter, we describe the generation and the characterization of
six cloned and stable LOU rat hybridoma lines which produce antibodies
specific for human apolipoprotein B in large quantities. These monoclonal
antibodies have affinity constants in the range of 109 M-1 and are
specific for all apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins. Comparatively
with the mouse model, no differences in immune response, efficiency of
fusion procedure, and chemical quality of rat monoclonal antibodies were
observed.

For various reasons which we have already explained, we consider that rat-
rat fusions are more interesting to perform than rat-mouse fusions.
However, the latter are efficient and can be done perfectly. In this
chapter, we shall describe such a rat-mouse fusion and its equivalent in
the normal rat-rat technology. The chosen antigen was the horseradish
peroxidase (HRP), which is a good immunogen for the rat.

LOU/C rat as wells as BALB/c mice were immunized with male Xenopus plasma
from animals stimulated by 17-beta-oestradiol. Both species reacted equally
well after two i.p. inoculations of 0.4 mg plasma proteins with complete
Freund adjuvant at a 1-week interval. The LOU rat chosen for fusion was
boosted by i.v. inoculation of 0.4 mg plasma proteins at days 3,2, and 1
before fusion. Fusion was carried out according to standard procedures in
the Experimental Immunology Unit of the University of Louvain. From the 17
hybridomas selected for their growing properties and their positive
response in an ELISA for vitellogenin, a single one was cloned and the
others frozen for 2 years. After limiting dilution, this hybridoma gave a
monoclonal antibody (MAb) producing hybridoma LO-VG1. This was typed as an
IgG2a immunoglobulin. After 2 years, two other hybridomas were rescued and
provided two MAbs, LO-VG2 and LO-VG3. The three antibodies exhibited
different electrophoretic mobilities. The work with these MAbs was pursued
in two directions: the purification of the MAbs and the setup of an
indirect sandwich ELISA for vitellogenin and antibodies directed against
this antigen.

The development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has offered the
opportunity of studying the distribution, structure and function of T
lymphocyte membrane antigens. Over the past years a series of molecules
present on the T lymphocyte have been defined by mouse MAbs; some have
been shown to be associated with T lymphocyte function. For instance, T
cell antigen receptor complex (Ti-T3) is recognized by CD3 MAbs (e.g.
OKT3) and by WT31; the receptor for Interleukin-2 is recognized by CD25
MAbs (e.g., TAC); and the T lymphocyte receptor for sheep erythrocytes
(E-receptor), which has recently been proposed as a ligand for LFA-3, is
recognized by CD2 MAbs (e.g., OKT11). Some antibodies to T-lymphocytes
mimic the effect of natural ligands or of antigen stimulation: OKT3 and
WT31 activate T lymphocytes through the T cell antigen receptor complex.
Certain combinations of CD2 MAbs activate T lymphocytes through an
alternative pathway.8CD4 and CD8 MAbs (e.g., OKT4 and OKT8), define
distinct subpopulations of T lymphocytes. The antigen defined by CD4 MAbs
is mainly expressed on T-helper cells and seems to recognize MHC class II
gene products, while antigen defined by CD8 MAbs is mainly expressed on T
suppressor/cytotoxic cells and seems to recognize MHC class I antigens.
We were interested in producing anti-human T lymphocyte MAbs in the
rat model because of the difference in immune repertoire between rat and
mouse. Moreover, because large quantities of rat MAb are easily produced
and purified and because some rat Ig isotypes have been shown to fix human
complement and to activate human killer cells, rat MAbs are attractive
reagents for clinical therapeutic use. Here, we report five rat MAbs
specific for human T lymphocytes.

The immunodot assay, originally described by McDougal et al., and adapted
in our laboratory, allows the determination of the heavy chain and the
light chain classes of mouse immunoglobulins (Igs). It is based on the
principle of a "sandwich immunoassay". The main feature of our assay is
the use of rat monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) anti-mouse heavy and light
chain isotype. These MAbs are dotted in sequence on strips of
nitrocellulose filter paper (5 x 80 mm, 0.22 pm porosity Schleicher and
Schuell). After saturation, the strips are incubated with the mouse
hybridoma supernatants and the mouse Igs, bound to the specific anti-mouse
isotype rat MAbs, are detected with a peroxidase-conjugated goat
polyclonal antibody directed against mouse Igs. The procedure for the test
is the same as that used for the determination of rat Ig isotypes
described in Chapter 11. The nature and the concentrations of the specific

The analysis of gene expression in human lymphocytes by two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D) has been the subject of many
papers. The identification of protein sets that characterize both the
normal and abnormal phenotypes of different subpopulations has been
documented. We have also shown that regulation studies performed by the
selective introduction of a variety of biological response modifiers into
the labeling cultures can be carefully and reproducibly analyzed by 2-D
gels and the set or sets of proteins under their control can be defined.
The work done over the past few years is largely responsible for our
current understanding of human lymphocyte 2-D patterns. As a continuation
of my studies of gene expression in normal and abnormal human lymphocytes,
I have analyzed the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-infected cell line,
HUT-102, by high-resolution two dimensional gel electrophoresis.
Comparisons of this pattern with HTLV-negative cell lines such as Jurkat,
GM-607, and HL-60 were made in order to preliminarily identify a set of
protein-gene-products whose expression is either related to viral proteins
in the cell or viral induction of host cellular proteins. During this
study, I also attempted to establish cell lines from Belgian patients with
T-cell malignancies and have been successful in obtaining several
different lines. This paper will mainly concern the cell line, WE17/10,
which was the first to be established in my laboratory and has been the
most thoroughly characterized at the present time. It is interesting to
note that most incidences of HTLV-related leukemia in Europe have been
associated with individuals who immigrated from the endemic regions of the
world or native Europeans who travelled to those areas.

Although prognosis of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer is
generally favorable, undifferentiated/anaplastic thyroid cancer is one of
the most aggressive malignancies. The remarkable difference in prognosis
between two types of thyroid cancer indicates that there is a large
biological difference between them. We have been involved in the studies
for exploring new biomarkers to evaluate aggressiveness of thyroid cancer.
These markers are useful not only for predicting prognosis but also for
developing new strategies against aggressive thyroid cancer. We recently
established three different thyroid cancer cell lines, KTC-1, KTC-2 and
KTC-3. KTC-1 cells are derived from a patient with poorly differentiated
thyroid papillary carcinoma. KTC-2 cells are derived from a patient with
anaplastic transformation from papillary thyroid carcinoma. KTC-3 cells
are derived from a patient with primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. To
test the hypothesis that overexpression of human epidermal growth factor
receptor (HER) 1 promotes malignant progression in thyroid cancer, the
relationship among expression levels of HER1 and a cognate receptor HER2
and effects of a HER1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib on cell
proliferation, cytokine secretion and the expression level of one of
thyroid differentiation markers, thyroglobulin were investigated using
these three cell lines. Gefitinib inhibited in vitro growth of the thyroid
cancer cells in dose-and time-dependent manners. No significant
correlation was observed between the antitumor effect of gefitinib and
expression level of HER1 or HER2. Gefitinib significantly decreased
secretion of angiogenic cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-8 in KTC-2 cells. In contrast, gefitinib
significantly increased secretion of both angiogenic cytokines in KTC-3
cells. Changes in secretion of IL-6 and parathyroid hormone-related
protein (PTHrP) induced by gefitinib were also different among thyroid
cancer cell lines. Gefitinib did not significantly change the expression
level of thyroglobulin in any thyroid cancer cell lines. These findings
suggest that gefitinib is effective for the treatment of aggressive
thyroid cancer but its influences on cytokine secretion from tumor cells
are different among thyroid cancers. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 has been
identified as an anti-angiogenic factor. We recently demonstrated that
TSP-1 expression negatively related to extrathyroidal infiltration as well as
angiogenesis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. To elucidate
the relationship between expression levels of p53 and TSP-1 in thyroid
cancer, we studied their expression levels in 75 papillary thyroid
carcinomas. There was an inverse correlation between expression levels of
TSP-1 and p53. Additionally, the effects of TSP-1 and anti-TSP-1 antibody
on invasion were investigated in six thyroid cancer cell lines using the
in vitro invasion assay. Angiogenesis related factors, VEGF, VEGF-C, TSP-1
and TSP-1 receptor (CD36) were expressed at various levels in all cell
lines. Invasion tended to be inhibited by TSP-1 in five of the six cell
lines. These effects inversely related to the expression level of VEGF or
VEGF-C. The effects of anti-TSP-1 antibody on invasion differed among cell
lines. These findings indicate that TSP-1 plays a certain role in invasion
of thyroid cancer cells, and that the effects of TSP-1 and anti-TSP-1
antibody on invasion are different among thyroid cancers.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are pluripotent, self-renewing cells
that can be isolated directly from the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) of the
developing blastocyst, created by in vitro fertilization (IVF) - those
who are not used in the treatment of infertility, which are classified as
non-viable embryos or donated for research. Once in culture, hESC are
capable of differentiating into numerous cell types derived from each of
three primary germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), along with
extraembryonic tissues that support development. A major application of
stem cells is to produce cells and tissues for medical therapies. The hESC
offer the possibility of a source of replacement cells and tissues is an
important new experimental system for studying human development and
modeling human disease. It is still not know why specific lines have
different levels of robustness and proclivities to differentiate into
specific lineages, although variables in culture history and genetic
background of the lines will likely play a large part. How such variables
affect these innate characteristics of the lines is currently a focus of
interest in the field. There is, and will continue to be, a need for
deriving new hESC lines for both basic research and clinical applications
due to loss of genetic and epigenetic stability during hESC culture and
manipulation and the considerable variance within the human genome between
individuals. The more lines that are generated, the clearer an idea we
will have as to what is happening. To promote research with hESC was
sought to obtain and characterize cell lines that more fully meet the
strict criteria for ease of handling, including mechanical and / or
enzymatic passages, simplified cryopreservation and thawing procedures,
defined culture media, karyotyping, immunocytochemistry, Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) typing, Embryoid Bodies (EBs) formation and simple methods
for differentiation in vivo. Our group was derived and characterized the
second Brazilian lineage of hESC, named BR-2, using a human embryo with
three pronucleus (3PN), non-viable, at the blastocysts stage, produced by
IVF for clinical purposes, after obtaining consent to donation to research

For the last 15 years, the viral vaccine manufacturing sector is looking
for new producer cell lines, easily scalable, highly permissive to various
viruses, and more effective in term of viral productivity. One critical
characteristic for such cell lines is their ability to grow in suspension
in serum free conditions at high cell densities. Regarding the pathogens
under focus, influenza virus causing severe epidemics both in human and
veterinary field is an important threat for world healthcare. The
manufacturing sector is still demanding effective production processes to
replace/supplement embryonated egg-based process and to provide efficient
response to such threats. Cell-based production, with a focus on avian
cell lines, is one of the promising solutions. Indeed, three avian cell
lines; namely duck EB66 cells (Vivalis), duck AGE.CR cells (Probiogen)
and quail QOR/2E11 cells (Baxter), are now competing with traditional
mammalian cell platforms used for influenza vaccine productions (Vero and
MDCK cells) and are currently at advance stage of commercial development
for the manufacture of vaccine and biologicals.

The DuckCeltTM-T17 derived line presented here is a novel avian cell line
developed by Transgene SA. To generate immortalized duck cell lines,
Transgene has used its proprietary DuckCelT technology which consisted in
constitutively expressing the duck telomerase reverse transcriptase
(dTERT) in primary embryo duck cells from spf eggs.

DuckCeltTM-T17 cells were able to grow in batch suspension cultures and
serum-free conditions up to 7 x 106 cell/ml and such growth was easily
scalable in bioreactors up to 3L. Permissivity for different viruses
including influenza has been evaluated. In the present study, DuckCeltTM-T17
cell line was tested for its abilities to produce various influenza
strains from different origins; human, avian and porcine. All strains were
satisfyingly produced with titres higher than 5.8 log TCID50/ml. H1N1
human strains and H5N2 and H7N1 avian strains were the most efficiently
produced with highest titres reached of 8 log TCID50/ml. Porcine strains
were also greatly rescued with titres of 4 to 7 log TCID50/ml depending of
the subtypes. Interestingly, maximal titres are reached at 24h post-
infection, allowing to have early harvest time.

Process optimization on H1N1 2009 Human Pandemic strain allowed to
identify best operating conditions for production (MOI, trypsin
concentration, medium and density at infection) allowing to improve the
production level by 2 log.

Cultured cancer cell lines are critical for canine prostate cancer
research and represent an invaluable resource for the field of comparative
oncology. Research on canine prostate cancer is often hampered by the
difficultly in acquiring sufficient tissue samples for laboratory studies
and affected dogs for clinical studies, due to the relatively low
prevalence of canine prostate cancer compared to human prostate cancer and
the reluctance of owners to pursue diagnostic tests and treatment due to
the disease's very poor prognosis. While cell lines do not replace tissue
samples or in vivo studies, they provide another option for studying
canine prostate cancer. In addition, they can be used to help determine
what future studies are likely to be the most valuable, so that in vivo
studies and studies on tissue samples can be focused on these areas.

Basal, luminal and intermediate prostatic epithelial cells can be
differentiated based on the expression of cytokeratin 5 (CK5), cytokeratin
14 (CK14), cytokeratins 8 and 18 (CK8/18) and tumour protein 63 (p63).
Uroplakin III (UPIII) is expressed by urothelial cells but not by
prostatic cells and so can assist in differentiating tumours of urothelial
origin from those of prostatic origin. Nine canine prostatic carcinoma
cell lines have been described but comparison of the expression of CK5,
CK14, CK8/18, p63 and UPIII between the cell lines and the original
tumours has not been reported for any of them. This means it is not known
if the cell lines recapitulate the expression of these characterisation
markers by the original tumours. Thus, we established a new canine
prostatic carcinoma cell line and then compared the expression of these
characterisation markers between the original tumour, the cell line and a
non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse
xenograft, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF).
We also performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the cell line to look
for genomic alterations.
